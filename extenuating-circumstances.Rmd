\index{Extenuating circumstances}

The aim of the Extenuating-Circumstances policy is to ensure you are not disadvantaged in your studies by serious, significant circumstances beyond your control. 

As described in the Plymouth Compass framework (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/teaching-and-learning/plymouth-university-compass), we encourage you to become a resilient and thriving individual and a competent and confident professional. This means that, while studying with us, we expect you to be able to deal with the inevitable ups and downs of life, including minor illnesses or personal issues, so that they don’t affect your studies and, in particular, your ability to attend or complete assessments. 

Sometimes, however, you’ll face a serious situation which has a significant impact on your ability to attend or complete assessments. The University calls such situations ‘extenuating circumstances’ (ECs). This extenuating circumstances policy describes how we can support you by taking such situations into account.

### Long-term health conditions
Long term health conditions can be described as conditions which:  

- are persistent, typically lasting for more than three months and often life-long

- cannot be resolved in a short time, or which will recur regardless of action, or which need to be managed on a long-term basis

- are a long-term or permanent illness that often results in some type of disability and which may require you to seek help with various activities

- can be managed but can ‘flare-up’
 
Examples of conditions which fall into this category are: Cystic Fibrosis, Costochondritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), Psychosis, and Bipolar Disorder.

If you have a long-term health condition, you should discuss any support needs with Disability Services (or equivalent in partner institutions) before or soon after commencing your programme of study. It is hoped that the condition can be managed and / or you can be supported sufficiently by Disability Services (or its equivalent in partner institutions). https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/services/learning-gateway/disability-and-dyslexia 

However, there may be times when unexpected difficulties or flare-ups arise. On these occasions, you are required to claim extenuating circumstances affecting specific assessments. However, rather than requiring you to provide evidence for your condition with every extenuating circumstance claim, if you have a long-term health condition, you may wish to complete a long-term ill health form, available from the Faculty Office (or equivalent for partner institutions). This form must be accompanied by a statement from your GP, hospital consultant or appropriate specialist responsible for your treatment which provides clear confirmation of the nature, severity, duration and effect of your condition on your studies. 

You should submit the form to the Faculty Office for consideration. Once a claim is authorised, you will continue to be required to submit an extenuating circumstances claim for any missed assignment submission deadline, test, or examination which is directly attributable to a flare-up of your long-term health condition, but you will not be required to resubmit evidence. 

As a result of this process, we may need to invoke the [Fitness to Study](#fitness-study) process to consider your case in more detail. 

You must inform your Faculty or partner institution of any change in your condition, whether improvement or deterioration, in order that the claim can be reassessed. The Faculty or partner institution may require further evidence from time to time. You will be contacted at the start of each academic year to review your case.  


### Fitness to Study {#fitness-study}

The university is committed to an ethos of equality and inclusivity, and aims to facilitate and promote positive health and wellbeing through the recognition and understanding of all relevant health conditions and disabilities. Occasionally a student’s circumstances or health may impact upon their own, or others’ ability to fulfil that potential. Levels of risk will be assessed by the university on a case-by case basis in conjunction with appropriate professionals.

The Fitness to Study policy and the accompanying procedures are to be followed by Plymouth University staff where significant concerns have arisen as a result of a student’s extended absence, health condition, wellbeing or other circumstances that lead to an inability to progress in their programme, or that adversely affect others. The key purpose of the policy is to ensure that the best interests of the student are met and to provide appropriate guidance and support.

## Key points

- Apply for EC as early as possible. Retrospective applications are not normally allowed.

- Don't submit coursework if you are unfit to complete it properly and plan to apply for EC. This is especially so if you have or can obtain corroborating evidence for the extenuating circumstances. Most reasonable claims are granted, but if you sit an exam or submit coursework you will be deemed to have been "fit to sit", and thus not able to claim extenuating-circs affected your performance.

- Applications for EC normally require corroborating evidence, but students are allowed to self-certify (e.g. for illnesses where medical attention would not normally be sought) once in each academic year.
