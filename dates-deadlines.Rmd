### Timetables {#timetable}

\index{Timetables}

Your personal timetable is available at: <https://timetables.plymouth.ac.uk>.
Note that your timetable might take a few days to settle down if you were late
in choosing your module options. A copy of the programme timetable (including
_all_ modules) is available on the programme site as a backup if you are stuck.

-   It is vital that you check your timetable in the first weeks of term. You
    should particularly check you registered on all the correct modules and for
    the current year.

-   If you spot any inconsistencies please email Karen Barnett or contact the
    programme lead.

_This is very important because module registrations on the DLE are used for
group-emails and notifications, and so you may miss important info if your
registrations are incorrect._

### The Academic year `r params$academic_year`

The University year is organised by week numbers which are assigned primarily
for the purposes of undergraduate teaching and so can sometimes be confusing for
MSc students. It's worth noting here that:

-   The year is organised into two semesters.

-   Vacation periods are not part of the semesters, although they interrupt
    them.

-   The research project does not fit neatly with the semester structure (as do
    taught courses). Expected work patterns for the project are explained in the
    separate project guidance notes.

The calendar on the following page shows the academic year.

-   Pink = welcome week
-   Yellow = teaching weeks
-   Blue = revision weeks
-   Green = examination weeks
-   Bank holidays are outlined in bold

The calendar also shows university week numbers, e.g. welcome week is week 8.
Official timetables, module outlines, and other university documents may refer
to these week numbers.
