# Timetables, dates and deadlines

### Coursework deadlines for `r params$academic_year`

\index{Deadlines}

Assessments must by submitted to the appropriate submission link on the relevant
DLE module page by 12 noon on the day of the deadline.

In the unlikely event of revisions to deadlines, these will be sent by email and 
the list of deadlines will be updated. 

```{r, echo=F, include=F}

## Timetables {#timetable}

\index{Timetables}

Your personal timetable is available at: <https://timetables.plymouth.ac.uk>.
Note that your timetable might take a few days to settle down if you were late
in choosing your module options. A copy of the programme timetable (including
_all_ modules) is available on the programme site as a backup if you are stuck.

-   It is vital that you check your timetable in the first weeks of term. You
    should particularly check you registered on all the correct modules and for
    the current year.

-   If you spot any inconsistencies please email Karen Barnett or contact the
    programme lead.

_This is very important because module registrations on the DLE are used for
group-emails and notifications, and so you may miss important info if your
registrations are incorrect._

## The Academic year 2020-21

The University year is organised by week numbers which are assigned primarily
for the purposes of undergraduate teaching and so can sometimes be confusing for
MSc students. It's worth noting here that:

-   The year is organised into two semesters.

-   Vacation periods are not part of the semesters, although they interrupt
    them.
