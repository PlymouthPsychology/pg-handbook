# Our expectations {#expectations}

Studying for a masters course is a big commitment. For you to get the best from
the year we expect you to:

-   [Attend](#attendance)
-   [Contribute (small group teaching only works if all students engage)](#contribute)
-   [Work hard (self-directed study is a crucial part of the course)](#self-study)
-   [Communicate with staff](#communicate-with-us) and
    [check your email every day](#email-expectations)

## Attendance {#attendance}

\index{Attendance}

Most students study for an MSc or MPsych as a full time course, and it places
considerable demands on your time and energies. Nonetheless, _we expect all
students to attend all scheduled classes, and some modules require attendance as
part of their assesment criteria._

We know from experience (and results data) that students who don't attend
perform poorly. We recommend that full time students undertake no more than 8
hours part time work per week while teaching is taking place (between September
and April) and it is essential that part time work does not interfere with your
attendance at lectures.

If there are unavoidable circumstances which mean that you cannot attend the
University you should register these as 'extenuating circumstances'. Please see
the section on [extenuating circumstances](#excircs) below (page
\pageref{excircs}). You should also discuss these circumstances with the
programme coordinator.

###### Attendance monitoring

\index{Attendance monitoring}

The University is currently initiating a policy of monitoring attendance on all
taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Details of this will be finalised
during the year, but it is possible that attendance will be monitored in
selected lectures and workshops throughout the year

The University also has specific policies on attendance and engagement for
overseas students, and those with Tier 4 visa requirements.^[More information

## Contributions in class

TODO

-   need to contribute for small group teaching to work.

## Communicate with staff {#communicate-with-us}

TODO - how should students communciate with us?

## Self-directed study {#self-study}

In addition to your timetabled classes, you will need to spend a _significant
amount of time reading, doing exercises, \index{Self study} completing
coursework assignments and revising for tests or examinations_. The University
expects a student to spend 100 hours undertaking a 10-credit module. Given that
you will be studying 180 credits each year, this equates to 1800 hours per year
– a substantial proportion of your time. You should bear this is mind if you are
considering part-time work, and ensure this does not impact on your ability to
study.

## Other expectation

If you change either your term time address or your normal vacation address
please make sure that you inform the School. Whenever possible please supply
telephone numbers with your addresses. The university has a strict policy of not
releasing students’ addresses to third parties.
