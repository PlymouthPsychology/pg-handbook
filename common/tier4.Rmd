Some international students will require [Tier 4 visas](https://www.gov.uk/tier-4-general-visa) to study in the UK.

The [UKBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Border_Agency) (United Kingdom Border Agency) has issued new requirements for students with a Tier 4 student visa:

The University must retain copies of the personal identity pages of your passport plus pages covering your current leave and all UK leave stamps, and a copy of the Identity Card for Foreign Nationals (if applicable). These documents must be copied before your faculty enrolment is completed. Details of scanning points on campus will be circulated.

Records of attendance must be kept for all students with a Tier 4 student visa applied for with a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies ) number. You will be asked to swipe your Plymouth University ID card in the reception of ISAS (16 Portland Villas) every 2 weeks during term time. It is important to keep your faculty or ISAS notified of any periods of non-attendance , perhaps due to absence from Plymouth or illness etc. You will be contacted if you miss more than 2 consecutive swipes.


- You must maintain up-to date personal contact details on the student portal at all times.
Please note: the university must report to the UKBA:

- A specified period of non-attendance

- If you cease to study at the university for any reason (withdrawals, suspensions,
interruptions etc)

- If your study circumstances change such as a change in course, or if the duration of
your course changes.

- If it is known that you are not complying with the conditions of your leave

Please see ISAS (International Student Advisory Service) to discuss or clarify any of the points above.
