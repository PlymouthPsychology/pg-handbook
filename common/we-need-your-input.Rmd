When things go wrong or could be made even better than they are now, it is quite likely that you will spot it before we do. So, it is important that you let us know when there are problems. These problems vary in how easily they can be addressed. Some can be dealt with straight away once they are brought to the attention of the right person. Other problems require more detailed consideration and widespread discussion, so they inevitably take longer to fix. Sometimes they are large enough to warrant a major course overhaul and may not be fixed in time to benefit you. However, such changes to the course will benefit those who follow on in the future. Sadly, there are some problems that are a consequence of resource limitations or external constraints, and we may not be able to do much about them, but at least we will be able to let you know the reasons why those problems exist. In any event, it is important that you let us know what you think, and you can be sure that your views will be an important part of any decision making process.
