The Senior Tutor, Sylvia Terbeck (<sylvia.terbeck@plymouth.ac.uk>), is responsible for co-ordinating academic and pastoral aspects of personal tutoring in the undergraduate programmes, and also acts as a ‘reserve’ tutor if the programme coordinator is not available, or if you have something to discuss that you would prefer not to raise with the programme coordinator. 

The [student advocate](#student-advocate) is an additional point of contact when the senior tutor is unavailable.
