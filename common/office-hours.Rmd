Our academic staff are based in Portland Square on the second floor of A block and B block. Staff typically specify two ‘office hours’ during the week when they are in their offices and available for student queries. Please use these office hours. Talking to us face-to-face is usually a friendlier and more efficient way of communicating than email, and students who come to our office hours tend to have a better experience. Many staff will be available to see you outside their office hours, but please make an appointment first via email. All our staff are researchers and administrators as well as teachers, so please don’t be offended if you drop by unannounced and we are busy.

It is anticipated that over the year an average student will see their tutor for about six hours during these sessions.
