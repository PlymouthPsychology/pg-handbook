The 'Plymouth Award' is a University-wide scheme designed to recognise the extra-curricular achievements of our students, pulling an individualâ€™s life-wide experiences together into a portfolio of experience, reflections and learning outcomes. We know that our students are involved in a wide range of activities and we want to enhance and celebrate these achievements.
Participants are required to carry out a minimum number of hours of activity from no less than three out of five key strands, and to complete this over the duration of their studies. A final award will be made to the student at the time of graduating.

The strands of activity include: 

- Personal health and well being
- Working life
- Volunteering
- Cultural and social awareness
- Supporting the University community
