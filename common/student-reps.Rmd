Course representatives are the most important channels of information for your views. The representatives serve an invaluable function. We take what they say very seriously, and we directly involve them in as much decision making as possible. For example, they constitute a major voice on the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programme Committees. 

It is important that you use your representatives to the full. In general the representatives undertake a lot of work, much of which is unseen by the majority of students. If you have an issue you can discuss it with one of your stage representatives and they can approach a member of staff or the Programme Leader to explore what can be done about the issue.

At the beginning of each academic year, students in each stage will be canvassed for volunteers to take on the role of student representative. The normal pattern is to recruit as many people as want to take on the role. The representatives for each stage then share out the responsibilities which go with the role. For example, one person might be good at organising meetings and summarising what happens at meetings whereas someone else might be better at speaking out at committees. One of the main responsibilities of the role is to communicate with the stage constituencies and to represent the views of the stage to those with operational responsibility for the programmes, usually at the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programmes Committee.

Photos and names of student reps will be posted on this site <http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/studentreps/>

Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email.
