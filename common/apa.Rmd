The school requires all coursework to conform to the APA style manual, version 6 ^[see https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/]

**Writing in APA style is simple but highly valued by many markers. Failure to comply with the rules will cause you to recieve negative feedback and poorer marks.**


The BPS styleguide is an excellent resource for writing and editing, and uses the APA rules as a basis for it's recommendations, but adds much more.

Unless other instructions are explicitly given by the module leader, you should fully reference each piece of coursework. Do not provide a bibliography in place of a reference list. Do not omit the reference list. However, the reference list does not contribute to the page count for the assessment
