Official module and programme documentation The University keeps an official, publicly available record of all current modules and programmes which it has validated. The record of a module is called a Definitive Module Record (DMR) and for a whole programme, it is called a programme specification. The DMR provides information on the aims, intended learning outcomes, indicative syllabus content of the module and other relevant matters. The programme specification provides information on the rationale, aims and intended learning outcomes of the programme as well as information on the way the programme is organised. You can find these documents by typing the module code or the phrase ‘Psychology Programme Specification’ into the search tab at the top of your portal start page. "],
["programme-overview.html", "Programme overview Taught modules Module choices Changing options or modules Module choice considerations for PT students.", " Programme overview The aim of the MSc in Psychological Research Methods (known as the PRM) is to provide a broad training in research methods used by psychologists, alongside specialist content in your research area. Students will understand the nature of psychological research work, including its philosophical background and ethical considerations. Specifically, students will Acquire working knowledge of the full range of methods available to psychological researchers. Acquire practical research skills, including skills in the communication of research. Develop practical competence in core methods for data analysis. Under appropriate supervision, design, conduct and report a major piece of research. Taught modules Each module is described on it’s own DLE page, and each will have a module outline which summarises the aims, the teaching schedule, key readings or references, and the assessment requirements for the module. PRM students must choose three out of the seven non-core modules. Code Core Credits PSY555 Yes Communication of Research for Psychology 10 PSY556 Yes Statistical Methods for Experimental and Clinical Research 10 PSY558 Yes Evaluating Complex Interventions 10 PSY559 Yes Experimental Research Design 10 PSY560 Yes Qualitative Research Methods for Psychology 10 PSY561 Yes Skills and Techniques in Psychological Research 1 10 PSY562 Yes Skills and Techniques in Psychological Research 2 10 PSY563 Understanding Risky Behaviour 10 PSY564 Understanding Cognitive Behavioural Therapy 10 PSY566 Issues in Behaviour Change 10 PSY567 Designing for Behaviour Change 10 PSY568 Issues in Clinical Psychology 10 PSY569 The Brain and its Disorders 10 PSY570 Issues in Cognitive and Brain Science 10 PSY571 Yes Project Planning and Literature Search 20 PSY572 Yes Project 60 PSY577 Foundations in Clinical Psychology: Children and Families 10 Module choices Prior to induction week the faculty administrator will email students with a list of options, from which they can select. This will also be provided during induction week for any students applying late. During induction week we run a number of sessions providing more information about modules, and all students need to confirm their semester-1 options within 1 week. Confirming module choices is important because it allows us to enrol you on modules on the university’s digital learning environment, which means you will get access to teaching materials and will receive email and other communications from the module leader. Changing options or modules Requests for changes to modules/options will be considered and accommodated where possible. Please make applications via email to the faculty administrator within the first two reaching weeks of each term. Where optional modules do not overlap in the timetable students are permitted to sit-in on additional classes, with the agreement of the module or programme lead. However you should be clear that you can only be enrolled on 180 credits in total, and will be required to submit CW for those modules you are enrolled on. Only modules for which you are enrolled will count towards your degree classification. Some modules contain multiple sub-options (e.g. PSY561/PSY562). Provided that space allows, and with the agreement of the option leader, it is permitted for students to attend more than one session in the first week and request to change options thereafter (although we cannot guarantee that all requests can be accommodated). Module choice considerations for PT students. For part-time students, consideration should be given to overall workload, and the balance of options across both years. This often means taking more credits in year 2 than 1, because PT students will be allocated a project supervisor and may complete much of the work required for the project, even though they are not officially enrolled on the project module PSY571. Typically, we recommend students complete PSY556, PSY561 and PSY571 in their first year, with 30 or 40 additional credits selected from taught options. PT students should confirm which modules they wish to take within 1 week of the start of term. "],
["the-digital-learning-environment.html", "The Digital Learning Environment", " The Digital Learning Environment You will hear much talk of ‘the DLE’, which stands for Digital Learning Environment. The DLE is central to your learning at Plymouth, and you need to familiarise yourself with it as soon as possible. Put simply, the DLE is a website run by the university to provide students with a central point for all course information, and for you to submit work and recieve feedback. You can login to the DLE at: http://dle.plymouth.ac.uk. Please make sure you check the following on the DLE as soon as possible: Your programme site The site for each of your semester 1 modules Your university email1. On each module site you should2 see: A module outline Key readings for the course Copies of lecture slides and handouts3 A place to submit coursework You should check your university email at least once per day to avoid missing important communications from the school. See the expectations section.↩ If any of these are missing or not obvious, please let the module leader or programme coordinator know↩ At least 48 hours before each lecture; normally much longer↩ "],
["coursework-submission.html", "Coursework submission Submitting work on the DLE", " Coursework submission Submitting work on the DLE Please note the following important points about submitting work on the DLE. When you submit work on the DLE, you may notice that you can submit multiple times. Some students find this helpful. It also allows students who are in the process of claiming extenuating circumstances (EC) to submit a draft of their work, to guard against the possibility their claim for EC is not granted. HOWEVER, this means that it is possible for you to submit work after the deadline, and you should know that if you do this without valid EC your mark will be capped at 50%. This capping occurs even if you have previously submitted a draft before the deadline, because the DLE does not record the content of this submission, and we can mark only the latest one added. Consequently, it’s extremely important for you to submit on time, and to avoid submissions after the deadline, unless you have a valid claim for EC. All work must be submitted on the masters standard template (see the programme DLE site). This form asks you to reflect on your own work, and indicate to markers any specific aspects of the work you’d like them to pay attention to when giving feedback. You should name the file you submit carefully, and include your student reference number in the filename. The best format for this is 123456_nameofcoursework.pdf, and this will save your marker a lot of of time, and generally improve their mood. Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word to name your file for you. Failure to use a sensible filename will result in immediate expulsion from the course4. Some other key points to remember: No matter how close to a deadline, work submitted after 4.00pm will be deemed to be late. All late work carries a mark of zero. If you are prevented from submitting work on time due to medical or other extenuating circumstances. Coursework should be submitted electronically via the relevant DLE module site. Submit a single copy on the proper coversheet, and with your student ID number printed clearly on the front page. It’s also helpful to include your student ID number in the header of subsequent pages. Your name should not appear on the coursework itself (we mark work ‘blind’, wherever this is possible, to ensure fairness) Keep an electronic copy of all your coursework until you graduate. Not really, but it is very annoying and can lead to delays in marking work↩ "],
["timetables-dates-and-deadlines.html", "Timetables, dates and deadlines The Academic year 2018/19 Timetables Coursework deadlines for 2018", " Timetables, dates and deadlines The Academic year 2018/19 The University year is organised by week numbers which are assigned primarily for the purposes of undergraduate teaching and so can sometimes be confusing for MSc students. It’s worth noting here that: The year is organised into two semesters. Vacation periods are not part of the semesters, although they interrupt them. The research project does not fit neatly with the semester structure (as do taught courses). Expected work patterns for the project are explained in the separate project guidance notes. Timetables Your personal timetable is available at: https://timetables.plymouth.ac.uk. Note that your timetable might take a few days to settle down if you were late in choosing your module options. A copy of the programme timetable (including all modules) is available on the programme site as a backup if you are stuck. It is vital that you check your timetable in the first weeks of term. You should particularly check you registered on all the correct modules and for the current year. If you spot any inconsistencies please email Karen Barnett or contact the programme lead. This is very important because module registrations on the DLE are used for group-emails and notifications, and so you may miss important info if your registrations are incorrect. Coursework deadlines for 2018 PLEASE NOTE THAT DEADLINES MAY BE CHANGED DURING THE YEAR IN THE CASE OF ERRORS OR OTHER UNFORSEEN CIRCUMSTANCES.

The ability of students to conduct and report a major piece of research work is of central importance. Students should be aware that the quality of the project work will be ofconsiderable interest to potential employers, PhD supervisors etc., with whom they may wish to work on completion of this degree. Project work has a large bearing on the reference given and potential employers may ask to see a copy of the project report. Approval of project topics and allocation of supervisors will be the responsibility of the Programme directors. In order to maximise the range of possible research topics, supervision may be arranged with any full-time member of staff of the School, not just those teaching on the programme. Additional requirements of MSc/PRM projects Both MSc Psychology conversion students and MSc PRM students complete the same project module, PSY572. This means you complete the same assessment, but MSc projects must demonstrate methodological knowledge and skill appropriate to their programme of study. Specifically, the design and analysis of MSc/PRM student projects should reflect the extended coverage given to methods in PSY556, PSY559, and PSY558, and also in the specialist skills modules. Projects need not demonstrate competence in every technique covered but – where relevant – reports should demonstrate students’ awareness of key concepts and handle data accordingly. Key concepts include: Statistical power Statistical inference and causation Pitfalls of null hypothesis significance testing Handling repeated measures data Missing data Issues in qualitative data analysis Where PRM students propose a project that requires only very simple analysis (e.g. pairwise correlations or simple t-tests) this may be appropriate if the project is methodologically demanding in other areas (e.g. recruitment, complexity of data acquisition), or where this is based on the recommendation of the supervisor. However it is generally expected that PRM projects will be more methodologically ambitious than undergraduate projects or MSc/PGDiP projects, and markers will normally award the highest marks only where this is the case. Points and participant payments MSc students are given 40 points within our research participation pool. More information (user guides) is available here: http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/Stage5/ MSc PRM and Conversion students also have a project budget of £120 which can be used to pay participants. Contact the school office for the relavant forms, and agree any payments with your supervisor in advance. Ethics All student projects must be approved by the faculty ethical committee before data collection begins, using the online system at http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/admin4/mscethics/Login.aspx. Where ethical approval is not required for a particular project, students must arrange for their supervisor to email the programme lead explaining why this is the case (e.g. project is a meta-analysis) to obtain a waiver. Failing to obtain ethical clearance or a waiver will cause you to fail the module. NHS ethics Students wishing to run projects based in the NHS will also need ethical clearance from the appropriate NHS ethics committee. Students wishing to run projects involving children will also need clearance from the Criminal Records Bureau. This may cause delay, so submission for ethical clearance well before the project planning deadline is recommended. Work with children or vulnerable adults Research with children recruited through specific institutions (e.g., Schools) will need, in additional to the ethical clearance from the School, the approval of the authorities in charge of the institution, the approval of parents. Projects involving children, vulnerable adults or NHS patients will also require clearance from the Criminal Record Bureau. This procedure can take several months. Supervision Students are expected to make to regular contact with their assigned supervisor and may be penalised if they run work which has not been approved. Supervisory contact is required for the following purposes: Advising on the literature review - although responsibility for detailed searches lies with the student Advising on and approving the design of the empirical work Advising on and approving the method of analysis to be used Advising on the interpretation of findings and the plan for the final report. The supervisor must not be asked to comment on drafts of the report itself which they will be responsible for marking together with a second independent marker. See also ‘conduct of the student’ below. Supervision out of term time Staff are not guaranteed to be on campus after the end of year period on the university calendar and the School cannot guarantee availability of supervision after this date (during the summer vacation). For this reason it is effectively a requirement that the empirical phase of the project work be completed by this date. It is strongly recommended also that students produce and agree with their supervisors a plan for the final report by the same date. Conduct and contribution of the student Our aim is that masters projects represent a substantial piece of research, which makes a novel and publishable contribution to the literature. This requirement usually dictates that students will work collaboratively with their supervisor, and both will contribute to the final design and analysis of the study. That is, projects are unlikely to be a truly independent piece of research. As a consequence, we do not customarily make detailed accounting of students’ contribution to projects and try to adjust marks accordingly. The reason is that it is not possible to devise a fair scheme to compensate students for their relative contributions to projects when the different facts of this contribution are not necessarily commensurable. However, we do provide second markers with information about your conduct during the design, running and analysis of the project, and our policy is to use this information where i) the work appears to sit at the threshold between two grade points or ii) to resolve discrepancies between the first and second marker. Thus, a student who submits a manuscript on the borderline between a grade of B+ and A-, but who made a substantial contribution to the design and development of their project, would be awarded the higher of these two grades. To reassure students who are engaging in detailed conversations regarding the design and analysis of their projects: this is both normal an expected. You will not be penalised for this because it is a normal part of science to collaborate with other researchers. Only where such help is deemed excessive, or the student overly-dependent on supervisory assistance would this become an issue, and your supervisor will discuss this with you should this uncommon situation arise. Publication of Projects Project work should be potentially of publishable standard. Although it is not formally required, we wish strongly to encourage the submission of project work for publication and offer some advice in this section. It will rarely be the case that a project report - however highly marked - will be suitable for submission as a journal article without alteration. Students should therefore consult closely with their supervisor about the amendments needed prior to submission. Since this will occur after the examination process, supervisors will be free to advise in detail and to contribute themselves to the write-up. The authorship of publications arising from projects would normally be joint between the student and supervisor with the student’s name appearing first. This is the default recommended since it is required that the student substantially contribute to design of the project as well as conduct the work, and hence merit first authorship. The level of supervisory input also expected, however, would usually imply justification for the supervisor as second author. Where a project needs considerable rewriting for publication which the student lacks time or skill to complete this, it may be agreed that the supervisor completes the write-up and appears as first author. If a student has not written up their research within two years, then the supervisor may use the research in publications, with themselves as first author and the student as co-author. Any student who succeeds in publishing a project, even if some time after leaving Plymouth, is requested to inform the Psychology modular masters co-ordinator and send a copy of the paper. Expenses Students are allowed up to £120 towards the cost of photocopying and running their research project. Spending (excluding photocopying) must be agreed with the Programme coordinator before purchases are made. Students must not order equipment/test etc from suppliers. All orders for supplies other than shelf consumables will be made through the school office. Writing up your project I have already made this paper too long, for which I must crave pardon, not having now time to make it shorter. Benjamin Franklin, 1750 The Master’s project is a substantial piece of work, and should be reflected in the care and attention given to the reporting of your results. However, the length of research reports is not a reliable indicator of the effort required to produce it, nor of it’s quality. To communicate your findings, we recommend that you identify a suitable high-impact psychological journal and organise your manuscript according to their authors instructions. Examples of suitable journals might include Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, or Qualitative Psychology. This will almost always produce a manuscript which has the follwing sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion Most journals will accept manuscripts in the region of 4,500 to 6,500 words with a maximum of around 5 tables and 5 figures, and with around 250 words allowed for the abstract. The upper limit for masters dissertations is 10,000 words, excluding tables and references. However we suggest that you aim to keep your report closer to the limits imposed by the major journals, unless there are specific reasons why a longer report is desireable, and you have agreed this with your supervisor. Where a project is overly long, or lacks precision in the writing, then this will be marked down accordingly. To be clear: there is an upper limit of 10,000 words that will only be appropriate in a few cases. Almost all reports will be between 4,500 and 6,500 words, varying with the nature of the project. If in doubt, check with your supervisor. Use of appendices Appendices should not become a dumping ground, and should only include information necessary for the scientific understanding of your work. Examples of things which should not be included in an appendix: Illustration of the primary task used (e.g., screen capture or diagram). This should be a figure in the main report, or you should simply cite the original paper describing the task. Where a task has many variants which might interest a reader but which aren’t central to communicating the findings, however, they might be included in an appendix. A copy of the participant consent form with signatures from all participants. Brief and debrief SPSS printouts. All relevant statistical results must be reported in the Results section, in the format prescribed by the American Psychological Association in their Publication Manual. Questionnaires. If using your own questionnaire or a questionnaire that is not protected by copyright, report it in a Table. If using a questionnaire protected by copyright, or a measure which is widely used and described in a another publication, you must make sure that your method section gives a good description of what the questionnaire assessed and how it was structured but you should not report the items. You must also make sure that you cite the source of the questionnaire. Typography and layout There is no page limit for the project, but please: Include a standard cover sheet. Use a 12 point font Use double line spacing (tables may be left singlespaced) Leave at least 4cm in the right hand margin You should include a title page with the following information: Title of the study The text “Thesis submitted to the University of Plymouth for the [MSc/MPsych in ___] by [your name]”, and the year at the bottom of the page. Next should be a page on which you copy the following text: “The work reported in this thesis received ethical approval from the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences and complies with the guidelines set by the British Psychological Society.” On this page you can also include acknowledgements (thank people who helped you get through your project and add any comment you see fit). On the next page would be your actual report. References should start on a page of their own. Figures and tables should be placed at relevant locations within the text and clearly labelled and numbered. Don’t copy them all to the end of the manuscript. Contribution of the student Second markers will be given information about the conduct and contribution of students. This should not be used for the routine adjustment of marks (e.g. higher marks for larger student contributions) but instead should be used to disambiguate work near grade boundaries, or to resolve discrepancies between markers. Indicative grades A mark of 50-59% or more indicates competent work of masters standard; a mark of 60-69% indicates work at the merit level and a mark of 70% or more indicates work at distinction level. Below are the characteristics of report which markers will use to determine your grade: For all masters courses, the pass mark is 50%. The sections below describe the sections of your report and the characteristics markers will use to determine your grade: Introduction Range, relevance and quality of understanding shown in the student’s reading of literature. Organisation and quality of the prose. You should aim to be concise and precise throughout the report. Clarity of the exposition of the rationale for the study, and the linkage with the literature review. NOTE: Because the project report should be modelled on the form of a journal article, introductions should be focused on specific aims and not contain detailed reviews of literature not directly relevant to the study. Method Quality of the design and relevance to the objectives of the study. Level of ambition in terms of both the scale of the study and the relative complexity of the methodology employed. This will vary between programmes, and markers will take account of the time available to complete the project: MPsych projects will typically be the simplest, because of time constraints; MSc PRM projects will be the most methodologically ambitious. Competence and thoroughness in the conduct of the study. Presentation of the method section in terms of clarity, organisation, thoroughness and concision. You should present all details necessary to replicate the study, but not more. Results Quality, competence, appropriateness, and thoroughness of the analysis of data. Organisation and clarity of the presentation of results. Appropriateness and quality of presentation of graphs, figures and tables. Discussion Clear exposition of the findings. Understanding and interpretation of the findings. Critical appraisal of the study and its methodology. Discussion of broader theoretical implications in the context established by the introduction. Quality of presentation of arguments; organisation, style and clarity. "],

["expectations.html", "Expectations Your attendance Attendance monitoring Self-study Communications and email Cancelled classes Withdrawal/Suspension from a Programme", " Expectations Your attendance Most students study the PRM as a full time course, and it places considerable demands on your time and energies. Nonetheless, we expect all students to attend all scheduled classes, and some modules require attendance as part of their assesment criteria. We know from experience (and results data) that students who don’t attend perform poorly. We recommend that full time students undertake no more than 8 hours part time work per week while teaching is taking place (between September and April) and it is essential that part time work does not interfere with your attendance at lectures. If there are unavoidable circumstances which mean that you cannot attend the University you should register these as ‘extenuating circumstances’. Please see the section on extenuating circumstances below (page ). You should also discuss these circumstances with the programme coordinator. Attendance monitoring The University is currently initiating a policy of monitoring attendance on all taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Details of this will be finalised during the year, but it is possible that attendance will be monitored in selected lectures and workshops throughout the year The University also has specific policies on attendance and engagement for overseas students, and those with Tier 4 visa requirements.7 Self-study In addition to your timetabled classes, you will need to spend a significant amount of time reading, doing exercises, completing coursework assignments and revising for tests or examinations. The University expects a student to spend 100 hours undertaking a 10-credit module. Given that you will be studying 180 credits each year, this equates to 1200 hours per year – a substantial proportion of your time. You should bear this is mind if you are considering part-time work, and ensure this does not impact on your ability to study. Communications and email Email is the main way in which staff in the School and for the University to communicate with you. Important messages about the programme, including changes to assessments, or changes in time and location of classes or exams, will be e-mailed to you. You must check your emails regularly – at least once a day during term time. All staff aim to respond to students promptly, and always within 2 working days. However, you should not expect staff to respond outside of normal working hours (roughly 9am-6pm), and should not rely on staff responding immediately when deadlines are looming. Out of term time, if a staff member is unavailable please contact the module leader or the programme coordinator. The school office will also be able to put you in contact with available staff. If you change either your term time address or your normal vacation address please make sure that you inform the Graduate School. Whenever possible please supply telephone numbers with your addresses. The university has a strict policy of not releasing students’ addresses to third parties. Cancelled classes If a class has to be cancelled, we contact you as early as possible, usually via email. Sometimes lecturers become unavailable (e.g. sudden illness) without much notice. When this happens, please help us by using your own contact networks to share information with other students. We will often provide a replacement class for any that is cancelled, or rearrange teaching so that all essential material is covered. Withdrawal/Suspension from a Programme There may be occasions when you decide to withdraw or interrupt your studies for certain reasons, you need to consult your programme lead and seek advice if you have a particular problem. If you decide to withdraw or interrupt you must inform the programme coordinator and the faculty secretary as soon as possible. Withdrawal/suspension of studies could have implications for the fees you owe. More information can be found at https://goo.gl/779Ywd.↩ "],

All assessment on the PRM is based upon coursework, and we have no formal examinations. Coursework is tailored to the needs of individual modules. Modules may have several coursework components which make up the total assessment. Assessment is a complex topic, but this section attempts to distill some of the key information which students need to understand how their work is assessed on the MSc and MPsych courses at Plymouth, including: ‘Level descriptors’: These are broad descriptions of what is expected from students on each type of course Learning outcomes and assessment criteria Marking schemes, grade boundaries Marking and moderation processes Brief summary All coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-, and all grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked. Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark which is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate courses is set at 50%. Overall degree classifications, which are shown on your final degree transcript, are awarded based on the average mark across all modules, as follows: Distinction (&gt;=70%, grades A- to A+)8 Merit (60-69%, grades B- to B+) Pass (50%-59%, grades C- to C+) Fail (&lt; 50%, grades D+ and below) If you ever have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader to discuss it9. Marking criteria and ‘Credit level descriptors’ Credit level descriptors define the level of complexity, relative demand and autonomy expected of a learner on completion of a unit or programme of learning. They provide a description of levels of learning through a hierarchy of knowledge and skills, and the characteristics and context of learning expected. Specific learning outcomes and assessment criteria can be derived from level descriptors. There are 8 ‘levels’ within the scheme used in the UK 10 and masters courses, including the PRM and final year of the MPsych, are at level 7. These are organised under the following headings, and describe things that you (the learner) should demonstrate in your coursework and conduct on the course: Development of Knowledge and Understanding The Learner… Knowledge base …has depth and systematic understanding of knowledge in specialised/applied areas and/across areas and can work with theoretical/research-based knowledge at the forefront of their academic discipline. Ethical issues …has the awareness and ability to manage the implications of ethical dilemmas and work pro-actively with others to formulate solutions. Disciplinary methodologies …has a comprehensive understanding of techniques/methodologies applicable to their own work (theory or research-based). Cognitive and Intellectual Skills The Learner… Analysis …with critical awareness can undertake analysis of complex, incomplete or contradictory areas of knowledge communicating the outcome effectively. Synthesis …with critical awareness, can synthesise information in a manner that may be innovative, utilising knowledge or processes from the forefront of the discipline/practice. Evaluation …has a level of conceptual understanding that will allow her/him critically to evaluate research, advanced scholarship and methodologies and argue alternative approaches. Application …can demonstrate initiative and originality in problem solving. Can act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level, making decisions in complex and unpredictable situations. Key/Transferable Skills The Learner… Group working …can work effectively with a group as leader or member. Can clarify tasks and make appropriate use of the capacities of group members. Is able to negotiate and handle conflict with confidence. Learning resources …is able to use full range of learning resources. Self evaluation …is reflective on own and others’ functioning in order to improve practice. Management of information …can competently undertake research tasks with minimum guidance. Autonomy …is an independent and self critical learner, guiding the learning of others and managing own requirements for continuing professional development. Communications …can engage confidently in academic and professional communication with others, reporting on action clearly, autonomously and competently Problem solving …has independent learning ability required for continuing professional study, making professional use of others where appropriate. Practical Skills The Learner… Application of skills … can operate in complex and unpredictable and/or specialised contexts, and has an overview of the issues governing good practice. Autonomy in skill use …is able to exercise initiative and personal responsibility in professional practice. Technical expertise …has technical expertise, performs smoothly with precision and effectiveness; can adapt skills and design or develop new skills and/or procedures for new situations. Translating level descriptors into learning outcomes and assessment criteria. There are a range of different types of assignments used on Masters’ modules. For example, your coursework might include: Oral presentations Statistical exercises Essays Grant applications Professional reports Group work Module outlines identify the learning outcomes expected of students and, when setting assessments, staff are encouraged to give clear guidance on what is required. The assessments set will relate to the learning outcomes and enable you to demonstrate the abilities described in the level descriptors. Categorical and percentage grades Across the school, all coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-. Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark (see table) which is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate courses is set at 50% Letter grade % A+ 100 A 88 A- 77 B+ 68 B 65 B- 62 C+ 58 C 55 C- 52 D+ 48 D 45 D- 42 F+ 38 F 25 F- 15 Our experience is that using categorical grades helps markers to remember to use the full range of the marking scale. When using only percentage marks, markers are often reluctant to award marks over 90%, for example. Using the full range of the scale helps us identify and reward students achieving at a very high level. Mapping between level descriptors and grade boundaries We find that it is useful for students to have a general guide as to the standards expected for work at each level of attainment on the MSc and MPsych degrees. Note that although different terminology is used (e.g. Distinction vs. First class award) these award categories overlap across the programmes Distinction (MSc) or First class award (MPsych): &gt;=70%, grades A- to A+ At this level students should submit work which is: Comprehensive and accurate coverage of relevant material. Demonstrates critical evaluation; clarity of argument; integration of material. Insight into theoretical issues and, where appropriate, Originality in exposition and treatment. There should be only very minor omissions, inaccuracies, or defects of presentation. Merit (MSc) or 2:1 (MPsych): 60-69%, grades B- to B+ Students will produce work that is: Accurate, relevant and informed, with good insight Shows only minor omissions and inaccuracies May include less comprehensive theoretical analysis than merits a distinction. Pass (MSc) or 2:2 (MPsych): 50%-59%, grades C- to C+) Coursework will be Generally accurate, relevant and well informed. Reasonably comprehensive Well organised and structured. Have generally clear presentation, with some critical evaluation and understanding shown. However work may also have: Some omissions and errors. Limited understanding or errors in some places. Arguments which are not fully developed, or which fail to address the question. Fail (&lt; 50%, grades D+ and below) Fails to address question or purpose of assessment directly 11 Provides cursory coverage of relevant material. Contains significant inaccuracies. Arguments poorly developed Assertions unsupported by evidence. Poor organisation and style. Referencing guidelines The school requires all coursework to conform to the APA style manual, version 6 12 If you are not familiar with the APA style guide please consult the information on the programme DLE site or speak to your tutor or programme coordinator. Writing in APA style is simple but highly valued by many markers. Failure to comply with the rules will cause you to recieve negative feedback and poorer marks. The project must also be awarded an A- or better↩ e.g. during their office hours↩ See the SEEC level descriptors document↩ This is incredibly common in the work of weaker students, and failing to address the question as posed is probably the primary cause of work being awarded a low-pass or fail.↩ see https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/↩ "],
["marking-and-moderation.html", "Marking and moderation Queries about grades awarded Anonymous marking Marking and feedback What happens if I fail an assessment? Relevant university regulations", " Marking and moderation All grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked, which involves the following steps: Peer moderation The first marker (normally the person who set the work) provides a small sample of coursework to a colleague for independent second marking, normally 6 scripts. The two markers compare the grades they have awarded to this sample and discuss any inconsistencies. Once satisfied that marks are being awarded consistently and at the correct level, the first marker continues to mark coursework from the rest of the cohort in the same fashion. Second marking This applies primarily to project reports. Here the first marker provides feedback for the student, and awards a grade. A second marker also reads the report and awards a second independent mark. Both markers meet to discuss the grade, and where inconsistencies arise these are resolved by discussion, or with reference to the programme leader if no agreement can be found (this is rare). External examiners In addition, all coursework and marking is validated by our external examiner — an independent academic from a different university appointed to uphold standards on our degree programmes. The external examiner will check samples of coursework from across the degree to ensure standards are properly applied, work is marked fairly and that suitable feedback is provided. For this reason, grades awarded during the year are not final and may be subject to amendment by subject examination committees. Queries about grades awarded If you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader to discuss it13. It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately. Anonymous marking The University has a clear preference for marking of coursework to be anonymous wherever possible. In brief the policy states: Anonymous assessment should ensure summative assessments are marked as far as possible and where appropriate without the student’s name or identity being made known to the marker or subject assessment panel. Anonymity provides reassurance for students and assessors against the perception of discrimination and bias entering the assessment process, and aims to ensure all students are treated equally. Anonymous assessment should not impede rapid feed forward and feedback to students. The full policy is available here: https://goo.gl/8nZx69 Marking and feedback Marked coursework will be returned via the DLE, within 20 days of submission14. Returned work will include feedback, but you should meet with your module leader to get more in-depth feedback or clarification/guidance on points raised if required. Please note that all marks awarded are provisional until they have been confirmed by the Award Assessment Board (in June). What happens if I fail an assessment? The rules which decide what happens if you fail an assessment are quite complex, but the important facts are: The pass mark for all masters-level programmes is 50% If you don’t submit an assignment you will get a mark of zero If you fail an assessment you may be required to resit some or all of the CW on that module. Marks for repeated coursework are normally capped at 50%^[except where extenuating circumstances apply. If you have questions about assessments and progression on a module please contact the school administrator, Karen Barnet. Relevant university regulations The University has many complex rules and regulations which relate to postgraduate and undergraduate-masters programmes. Most of the time you will not need to study the detail of these. However, a copy of the Plymouth University regulatory framework for taught post-graduate awards is available online at: https://goo.gl/7uE51O A copy of the Plymouth University regulatory framework for taught post-graduate awards is available online at: https://goo.gl/7uE51O.

["academic-dishonesty.html", "Academic dishonesty University rules on AD Plagiarism Preventing academic dishonesty Consequences of academic dishonesty", " Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, collusion, cheating in exams and fabricating data. These practices and others related to dishonesty probably constitute the dirtiest words in academia, and they are quite properly punished severely where they are detected and proved. It is your job to familiarise yourself with the rules on plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Ignorance of the rules and expectations is not an excuse. University rules on AD The University has very strict regulations about academic dishonesty. You will need to know what counts as academic dishonesty according to the university regulations and make sure you avoid committing any action which could be construed as dishonest. Below is a list of practices which the University has identified as common instances of dishonesty. (these examples are not necessarily exhaustive). Obtaining or attempting to obtain access to an unseen examination or test paper prior to the start of the examination/test. The introduction or use in an examination/test of any books, notes, paper or devices of any kind other than those specifically permitted in the rubric of the paper. Failing to comply with the instructions of an invigilator or examiner, or with the printed instructions for candidates. Removing from an examination or test any script, paper, or other official stationery (whether or not completed) unless specifically authorised by an invigilator or examiner. Being party to any arrangement whereby a person other than the candidate fraudulently represents, or intends to represent, the candidate in an examination or test (personation). Communicating, or attempting to communicate with another student or with any third party other than the invigilator/examiner during an examination or test. Use of crib sheets, revision notes etc at any time during an examination or test. Copying or attempting to copy the work of another student, whether by overlooking his/her work, asking him/her for information, or by any other means. The submission for assessment of material (written, computer-generated, visual or oral) originally produced by another person or persons, without indicating that the material is not original, such that the work could be assumed to be the student’s own. The unauthorised use of the work of another student (whether by taking a hard copy without permission or through access to an electronic copy). The representation of work produced in collaboration with another person or persons as the work of a single candidate. The inclusion in a piece of assessed work (other than an examination or in-class/end-module test) of material which is identical or substantially similar to material which has already been submitted for any other assessment within the University. Making false declarations in an attempt to obtain special examination arrangements or special consideration (e.g. of extenuating circumstances). The presentation of data in laboratory work, projects etc based on work purporting to have been carried out by the student but which has been invented, copied, altered or otherwise falsified. Attempting to persuade another member of the University (student, staff, or invigilator) to participate in any way in actions which would be in breach of this Regulation. Being party to any arrangement which would constitute a breach of this Regulation. Plagiarism Plagiarism is one of the commonest forms of academic dishonesty; it isessentially copying or closely paraphrasing the work of another personwithout clearly indicating what has been copied or the source of thecopying. With the ready availability of the internet and the increasingaccess to on-line resources, it has become ever easier to commitplagiarism. The counter point to this trend is that with moresophisticated computer programmes and internet search engines, it isactually becoming more easy to detect plagiarism. As well as cases where an individual student has intentionally set out to deceive the marker, it is not uncommon for students to commit some form of plagiarism but be unaware that they have committed an offence. In these circumstances, the most common mistakes are for students to: Paraphrase the original source too closely Paraphrase the original source too closely by changing the grammar or individual words of the original only slightly. Even though the student’s work is not a direct quote it is still copying the ideas and expression of those ideas too closely. Solution: make sure you paraphrase key ideas from a source entirely in your own words. Using notes directly Making notes from a source (journal or book) which is a copy the original and then forgetting that your notes are a copy. When you come to write your assessment what you have in your notes sounds good so you use that material in your essay. However what you have put into your essay is a direct quote or a close paraphrase of the original. Even though the student may claim that they did not intend to commit plagiarism, such cases will still be treated as plagiarism and punished accordingly. Solution: When you write notes from another source always make your notes clear about what the source is and what is a quote or close paraphrase. The use of direct quotations The use of direct quotations or lightly paraphrased text without citing the source would be deemed to be an assessment offence. Where work was similarly presented, without quotation marks, but with a clear indication of the source this would be identified as bad practice and marked accordingly. In the latter case, overly-derivative work showing little intellectual input from the student would be likely to be given a low mark, and if extensive the work would be almost certain to fail. Solution: If you must quote a source put the quote in quotation marks and reference it correctly both in the body of the essay and in the full reference list. It is however better to synthesise the ideas and put them into your own words. You will still need to reference the source of the ideas. Preventing academic dishonesty Everyone involved in higher education is responsible for preventing the incidence of academic dishonesty. Prime responsibility rests with students themselves. You can help reduce the incidence of academic dishonesty through following these points of principle: Be organised in your work Students committing academic dishonesty often claim that time pressures and last minute panic led them to cheat. Such panic might be a reason for cheating but it does not excuse it. You can reduce the likelihood of such pressures by being organised, knowing what assessment deadlines you have to meet, and planning your work accordingly. If you are not a good organiser, take advice. Advice is available from your personal tutor, from study skills courses run by the University and from your network of friends and colleagues. Know the rules It is tremendously important to know what counts as academic dishonesty. One problem is of course that there is no hard and fast cut off between honesty and dishonesty; there are gradations between best practice and utterly dishonest practice. It is essential that you get a sense of where the boundary lies on this gradation. In Stage 1, this topic will be discussed as one of the tutorial topics. There are also exercises available on the student portal which aim to help you understand where this boundary lies. Sometimes students plead that ignorance of the rules led them to cheat. Again this ignorance may be a reason for cheating, but it does not excuse it. Don’t ignore dishonest practice There are occasions where you suspect a fellow student of committing academic dishonesty. The most common form of this practice occurs where another student uses or copies your work without your permission. If you suspect that someone is cheating in this way, then you can talk to your personal tutor, the relevant marker, the relevant module leader, the stage tutor or programme co-ordinator all in confidence. If your suspicion is well founded then the member of staff will take steps to detect the cheating without involving you directly. Be aware of detection systems The School of Psychology has systems for checking work submitted for assessments and detecting academic dishonesty. The marker is obviously in a good position to detect cheating such as plagiarism. The School may also ask a randomly selected sample of students to submit electronic copies of their assessment after the deadline has passed. These copies will be subjected to plagiarism detection software which compares the content of essays with that of other student essays and with text on web sites and in journals and books. By being able to match the content of the essay with these different sources, this software now has a very high detection rate for plagiarism. Consequences of academic dishonesty If a marker believes your assessment shows signs of cheating, then the university procedures will be followed. When the student has been informed by the module leader that he or she is suspected of an offence under the university regulations, then they will have an opportunity to discuss this charge with the module leader. The student then has to decide whether to accept the charge or contest it in front of a faculty committee. If a student is found guilty of academic dishonesty then they will be punished, usually as a minimum by having the grade for the work submitted or the module as a whole reduced to zero. Every year, a number of students have their marks reduced and fail the modules concerned. If you have your marks reduced to zero because of academic dishonesty then the impact on your overall mark profile and your eventual degree classification can be high. The information will be kept on your academic file, and may be referred to by your tutor or other member of staff when writing a reference for you after you leave the University. A second offence may lead to removal of the student from their programme of study. "],

Without feedback from you we can’t improve the way we deliver the course. If you have a question, we recommend the following steps, in roughly this order: Consult this handbook. Check the programme and module DLE sites. Ask the module leader. Speak to your Student Rep, the Student Advocate or the Programme Coordinator as appropriate. Informal feedback You can meet with academic staff at any time during the year. All staff have two office hours which they should make known during lectures, and during these periods you can drop in with questions without an appointment. Staff are also happy to meet students by appointment (email them) at any time during the term. As an aside, we find that students who meet regularly with academic staff during the year are often those who perform well on the degree. Don’t hide away if you have questions or are unclear on material from lectures — asking questions is the best way to learn. Course Reps and The Student Advocate Student reps are psychology students who have either volunteered or been elected to represent all students on their programme. Reps have an important role in communicating your views to the School. They are supported by a senior member of staff - the Student Advocate - who helps them turn your suggestions about the course and the School into actions. Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email.15 Dr Patric Bach is the schools’ Student Advocate this year. His role is to mentor the student reps and help them maintain excellent communication between you and the School. Patric works with reps across all stages and all programmes in Psychology, including the MPsych Advanced Psychology, BSc (Hons) Psychology and joint honours programmes, and our postgraduate Masters and DClinPsy programmes. Reps for the MSc courses and the Student Advocate attend meetings of the Postgraduate Programme Committee twice a term to present the issues relevant to their course, including teaching and assessment arrangements, the coverage of the course, and issues with the wider university. Their role is to make the voice of Psychology students heard at School level and to communicate the position of the School of Psychology back to students. The MSc Programme Committee The Programme Committee is a formal venue for the management of the programme, and the exchange of views between staff and student. Elected student representatives are invited, and meetings are normally held at least twice a year. We earnestly hope that students will feel able to raise problems informally (and before these meetings) so they may be dealt with as soon as possible. 16 Regular student evaluation All students are asked to give structured feedback on each module they take and module Evaluation Forms are sent to students at the end of each term. These forms are completely anonymous; please be frank and open in your comments. This feedback is one of the primary ways in which we can improve the programme. Contact details for the student reps will be posted on the programme DLE site once they are appointed, after 30th September.↩ See the programme DLE site for more information about the programme committee.↩ "],

At other times please contact campus security. General Obligations All members of the School are expected to act at all times in a responsible manner and to set an example in safe behaviour, in particular by: Adhering to procedures agreed on their behalf for securing safe working conditions N for example by using protective clothing and equipment when provided Ensuring familiarity with location of fire exits, fire extinguishers and emergency procedures as posted on the School Notice Boards Reporting observed safety hazards immediately to the Technicians (Room 109) or to the School Office (B223 PSQ). Use of Equipment School equipment is issued for use on the understanding that it is in no way altered or modified by the user (other than by making such routine adjustments as may be deemed part of the operation of the equipment). If a defect is suspected or the user has any doubts about the operation of equipment, a technician must be consulted immediately. Conduct of Experiments All experiments must be conducted within the spirit of the Guidelines for Psychological Research issued by the British Psychological Society and it is the duty of all members of the School to be familiar with these Guidelines. Children in the University The University’s properties are not intended or designed for use by children and there are many hazards for them: if members of the School bring children with them onto University premises, they are responsible for supervising them the whole of the time the children are there. This means not only making sure the children themselves are safe, but also preventing them from doing anything that might endanger others. Visitors to the University Visitors to the University are responsible for taking care of the health and safety of themselves and others, but a member of the School who brings a visitor into the School must ensure that they are aware of specific safety precautions Animals in the University No animals other than those required for academic purposes may be brought onto the University site except guide dogs for the blind. Conduct in Other Parts of the University All members of the School are expected to familiarise themselves with the safety requirements applicable to other locations and at all times conduct themselves in accordance with such requirements. Responsibilities The Head of the School is responsible to the Vice Chancellor of the University for Health and Safety within the School. The Technical Manager, (Room 109) is the Safety Assistant. It is the duty of all members of the School responsible for particular activities N lectures, practical classes, experiments etc. N to ensure that such activities are conducted in a proper and safe manner. Fire Wardens The Fire Wardens are responsible for evacuating the school offices/labs on the first and second floors of the Link Building and for evacuating the second floor School offices in Portland Square in case of fire or other emergency. When the alarm bell sounds or the warning light comes on in the experimental cubicles, it is expected that everyone will co-operate by leaving the building in an orderly fashion. Procedure in Case of Accident or Dangerous Incident All incidents are to be reported to the School Safety Manager, (the Head of the School) and recorded on appropriate forms, available from Room 109. All injuries should be treated, even if apparently trivial, since secondary damage or infection may occur. There is a qualified first aider, Lynne James, in Room 109 (Technical Workshop) and a first aid box is also to be found in this area. In the case of accidents, the first action should be to contact the nearest first aider or to contact the emergency number (phone 3333), or both. Main Risks Electrical All electrical equipment must be connected using standard plug fittings, with a fuse of the correct rating for the apparatus in question, and properly earthed Electrical or other equipment must not be tampered with in any way. If there is a problem, contact the Technicians in Room 109 Do not use electrical equipment with wet hands. Fire Operate the nearest alarm or ring 999 If safe to do so, attempt to extinguish the fire using an appropriate extinguisher. If not, evacuate the area quickly and await further instructions at the muster point Do not use lifts when evacuating the building. In order to carry out the above procedure, it is essential to know where the fire extinguishers are, where the fire alarms are, and which is the appropriate muster point for each area. Details of these are posted on the School Noticeboards. General Laboratory Safety Procedures No smoking is allowed in any laboratory areas or in the corridors. It is permitted only in the rooms of members of staff who approve of such unhealthy activities No food or drink is allowed in any laboratory area High standards of behaviour must be maintained in all laboratory areas. Do not run around, shout or carry out any procedure that could disrupt laboratory activities All experiments must be conducted under the ethical guidelines for psychological research as laid down by the British Psychological Society Anyone introducing a visitor to a laboratory is responsible for ensuring that they adhere to the appropriate safety regulations No animals should be brought into the School without the express permission of the Safety Manager.

These include: Dedicated staff labs. These facilities are open to postgraduate use through the staff research groups who use them. Facilities include ERP Lab (101), Baby Lab (208), Soft Lab (209), Well-being Lab (210), EMG Psycho-physical Lab (213), Eye tracker Lab (214), Vision Specialist Labs (215), Audiology Lab (216), VR Lab (217) The observation labs (203 &amp; 205) Labs capable of running five to eight simultaneous participants. From October - March there can be quite high demand for labs and we implement the following measures to ensure fair access for all: You can only book 3.75 hours a day, which can’t span lunch. Sessions end and key cards must be returned at 12:45 for the morning and 16:45 for the afternoon. You must obtain ethical clearance before booking lab time. Experimental software/hardware The Technical Office can write custom applications and produce special hardware to fill most experimental requirements – contact the technical manager for more information. If requesting the tech office write software for your experiment, we strongly recommend that you: Specify what you want to appear on screen in as much detail as possible, including mockups in power point and with list Specify exactly how you want the data to be recorded, and what variables should be saved Test the software thoroughly before using with participants. This should involve a complete run-through of the experiment followed by an attempt to analyse the resulting data. It is only by attempting to analyse the data saved that many problems can be identified. It can also help to create a paper prototype and test this with other students before sending the spec to the tech office17. Recruiting experimental participants The school runs a participant pool of undergraduates – the Points Pool – who are required to participate in studies as part of their course, and also a panel of paid public participants – the Paid Pool – who provide a wider demographic and are paid £4 for 30 mins if you have the funding. Both pool systems are managed online and can be accessed at: http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/Stage5/. Borrowing Equipment There is a selection of equipment available for loan from the Technical Office, including computers, cassette recorders, stopwatches etc. If you intend to remove the equipment from the campus then a loan form must be signed, as equipment is not insured when off campus. Security All rooms containing equipment must be left locked whenever the room is left unattended even if this is only for a short period. If you are the last person to leave a laboratory it is your responsibility to ensure that it is locked, the technicians in room 109 will always have a key. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the computer labs are not left unlocked when there is nobody using them. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping↩ "],
