For you, this year is the start of a fascinating intellectual journey to the heart of psychology. Whether you are returning after several years of work, joining us from another institution, or continuing your undergraduate study at Plymouth, psychology is an exciting and dynamic subject. It has grown enormously in scope and influence within the last decade or so. The range of expertise of our staff reflects this dynamism and diversity. We are sure you will enjoy the opportunities that studying within this environment will bring. Your work this year will form an essential foundation for postgraduate study of psychology, or advanced psychological practice. Graduates of the course have succeeded in a wide range of academic, and professional roles, and the course is designed to help you maximise your ability to exploit psychological knowledge to succeed in the workplace. It is important that you remain focused on your work, and do well in your assessments. Remember, if you need advice or help with an area of work or with something outside the course that affects your work, you have a personal tutor who is a member of staff in the School, and you can approach him or her when you need to. The best way to contact them is via email, or Zoom call. Your fellow students are another important source of help and advice: our community of masters students is tight knit and supportive, so make the most of your peers. The information in this handbook complements the University’s online student handbook. It is helpful if you familiarise yourself with the contents of both before teaching starts, and you will need to refer to it throughout the year. If you have previously studied at Plymouth, you will find somethings familiar, but many aspect of postgraduate life will still be new. Of course, this year is going to be different, because of the impact of the Covid19 pandemic. Over the summer, working with our current students, we have developed a blended learning approach to our courses, mixing online delivery with face-to-face teaching where possible. We have tried to design our courses to give you the best experience we can, while at the same time ensuring the safety of everyone (students and staff). Of course, for this to work, it is imperative that everyone follows the University’s Covid-19 guidelines. If you have a question about the programme this year, then you should be able to find an answer in this handbook or the DLE. For more general queries, the ‘student portal’ can be accessed from the University’s sign-in page. The University’s landing page for new and returning students is also a key site for all kinds of information and FAQs here. Alternatively, you can ask your tutor or programme lead. The staff in the School of Psychology welcome you as a fellow member of the School and of the University, and look forward to working with you on the challenge and excitement of studying psychology. Good luck, enjoy your year with us, and stay safe. Professor Tim Hollins Head of School "],
["the-programmes.html", "The Programmes Official module and programme documentation External validation", " The Programmes There are 4 taught postgraduate programmes at Plymouth, as well as a ‘conversion’ MSc for students who have not studies psychology before. As shown in the table below, students on MSc awards study 180 credits through the year, whereas students on the MPsych study 120. Programmes are either in ‘Advanced Psychology’ (AP) or ‘Clinical Psychology’ (CP). Students on the AP and CP awards will often share modules. The MSc Psychology coversion course is linked to the UG programme, and is not linked to the AP/CP awards. Award/Subject MSc MPsych Advanced Psychology 180 credits 120 credits Clinical Psychology 180 credits 120 credits The MSc Psychology (conversion) This course is a taught MSc programme, but is designed for students without a psychology degree who wish to gain BPS accreditation. The MSc conversion is run separately from the AP/CP awards, and you won’t be taught alongside these students. For more details on the MSc conversion course see: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/msc-psychology Official module and programme documentation The University keeps an official, publicly available record of all current modules and programmes which it has validated. The record of a module is called a Definitive Module Record (DMR) and for a whole programme, it is called a programme specification. The DMR provides information on the aims, intended learning outcomes, indicative syllabus content of the module and other relevant matters. The programme specification provides information on the rationale, aims and intended learning outcomes of the programme as well as information on the way the programme is organised. You can find these documents by typing the module code or the phrase ‘Psychology Programme Specification’ into the search tab at the top of your portal start page. Details of the standard University academic regulations can be found at this link: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/governance/student-handbook External validation Each year external experts visit the school to check our teaching and marking, and listen to students about their experience on the course.

["expectations.html", "Our expectations Attendance Contributions in class Communicate with staff Self-directed study Code of conduct Other expectation", " Our expectations Studying for a masters course is a big commitment. For you to get the best from the year we expect you to: Attend Contribute (small group teaching only works if all students engage) Work hard (self-directed study is a crucial part of the course) Communicate with staff and check your email every day Attendance Most students study for an MSc or MPsych as a full time course, and it places considerable demands on your time and energies. Nonetheless, we expect all students to attend all scheduled classes, and some modules require attendance as part of their assesment criteria. We know from experience (and results data) that students who don’t attend perform poorly. We recommend that full time students undertake no more than 8 hours part time work per week while teaching is taking place (between September and April) and it is essential that part time work does not interfere with your attendance at lectures. If there are unavoidable circumstances which mean that you cannot attend the University you should register these as ‘extenuating circumstances’. Please see the section on extenuating circumstances below (page ). You should also discuss these circumstances with the programme coordinator. Recording of sessions Lecture-style sessions will be recorded and made available on the DLE. Other sessions with portions that lend themselves well to being recorded will also be made available. By attending the lectures and workshops, you consent to being recorded. Note that it will not always be possible or appropriate to make some sections of sessions available as recordings (e.g., those with group discussions containing sensitive material). Note also that the lecturer who delivers the session is responsible for ensuring that the recording is available on the DLE, but it can sometimes take several hours or longer to appear if the central server is busy. Attendance monitoring The University is currently initiating a policy of monitoring attendance on all taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Details of this will be finalised during the year, but it is possible that attendance will be monitored in selected lectures and workshops throughout the year. Your attendance at each online lecture may be automatically logged on our attendance monitoring system. The University also has specific policies on attendance and engagement for overseas students, and those with Tier 4 visa requirements.1 Contributions in class Many of our courses require active class participation and the use of group work. It is vital to the success of the course that students are prepared to participate in small group teaching In order to ensure that all students receive the maximum benefits from this model of teaching. Communicate with staff It is important that you keep staff on the programme informed of your progress at all times. If you are unable to attend sessions it is important to email the programme lead and module lead. Please also contact the program lead or your tutor if you are experiencing any difficulties that may be affecting your studies. The sooner we are aware of problems, the more able we are to help. All staff have office hours every week where students can drop in without making appointments. If you are unable to attend and staff member’s office hours, please email them to arrange a meeting at a different time. Staff will usually contact students via email so please check your student email account regularly. Self-directed study In addition to your timetabled classes, you will need to spend a significant amount of time reading, doing exercises, completing coursework assignments and revising for tests or examinations. The University expects a student to spend 100 hours undertaking a 10-credit module. Given that you will be studying 180 credits (MSc) or 120 credits (MPsych), this equates to 1800 hours (MSc) or 1200 (MPsych) per year – a substantial proportion of your time. You should bear this is mind if you are considering part-time work, and ensure this does not impact on your ability to study. Code of conduct The University is committed to creating an environment where all members of its community are respected, treated with dignity and feel safe, as well as ensuring the proper working of the University. We have a Student Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Procedure, which serves as a framework to help students understand what is expected of them, what standards of behaviour they can expect from other students, and what happens if those expectations are not met. Please read it here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/student-conduct Other expectation If you change either your term time address or your normal vacation address please make sure that you inform the School. Whenever possible please supply telephone numbers with your addresses. The university has a strict policy of not releasing students’ addresses to third parties.

["our-commitment.html", "Our commitment Listening to our students Resolving problems promptly Clear communication Equality and Diversity", " Our commitment Listen to you Resolve problems promptly, as they arise Communicate clealy Act fairly, and without discrimination Listening to our students Have your say Your experience matters to us – much of what we do is aimed at helping you learn, so we need to know whether we are doing the right things. The School of Psychology is a learning community, and students should consider themselves active participants. When things go wrong or could be made even better than they are now, it is quite likely that you will spot it before we do. So, it is important that you let us know when there are problems. These problems vary in how easily they can be addressed. Some can be dealt with straight away once they are brought to the attention of the right person. Other problems require more detailed consideration and widespread discussion, so they inevitably take longer to fix. Sometimes they are large enough to warrant a major course overhaul and may not be fixed in time to benefit you. However, such changes to the course will benefit those who follow on in the future. Sadly, there are some problems that are a consequence of resource limitations or external constraints, and we may not be able to do much about them, but at least we will be able to let you know the reasons why those problems exist. In any event, it is important that you let us know what you think, and you can be sure that your views will be an important part of any decision making process.

If you have a question now, take a look at our guide to getting questions answered. The student charter The Student Charter is an agreement between the University, the Students’ Union, and the student body. It sets out the expectations that you should have of the University, and also the expectations we have of you. For instance, you can expect that we will provide you with a challenging and invigorating curriculum, and we expect you to take an active role in your learning. We hope the charter provides a useful framework for both staff and students. You can find the full text here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/student-charter Informal feedback You can meet with academic staff at any time during the year. All staff have two office hours which they should make known during lectures, and during these periods you can drop in with questions without an appointment. Course Reps and The Student Advocate Student reps are psychology students who have either volunteered or been elected to represent all students on their programme. Reps have an important role in communicating your views to the School. They are supported by a senior member of staff - the Student Advocate - who helps them turn your suggestions about the course and the School into actions. Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email.2 Dr Patric Bach is the schools’ Student Advocate this year. His role is to mentor the student reps and help them maintain excellent communication between you and the School. Patric works with reps across all stages and all programmes in Psychology, including the MPsych Advanced Psychology, BSc (Hons) Psychology and joint honours programmes, and our postgraduate Masters and DClinPsy programmes. Reps for the MSc courses and the Student Advocate attend meetings of the Postgraduate Programme Committee twice a term to present the issues relevant to their course, including teaching and assessment arrangements, the coverage of the course, and issues with the wider university. Their role is to make the voice of Psychology students heard at School level and to communicate the position of the School of Psychology back to students. Formal feedback and evaluation of the programmes At various points whilst studying on your programme, you will be asked to provide formal structured feedback about the modules you are studying and the programme as a whole. This feedback takes two forms. First, the School of Psychology asks you to complete a module evaluation in each semester. These evaluations are online and are completed by accessing a special module evaluation web page. This web page is accessible via the DLE. You will be given instructions on how to access the page at the time when module evaluations are required. Second, the University asks MSc students to complete an annual University-wide survey. This allows the University to track the views of students about their course and the University facilities. When you are asked to complete one of these evaluations, please take the time to do so. The information which can be obtained from them is vitally important in monitoring the quality of courses, and provides information which can help in the planning of future courses and facilities. All responses to these evaluation instruments are confidential or anonymous. You will never be identified as an individual. There will be no comeback on you in any form for any views which you express in these surveys. Feedback box We also have an online feedback box, which you can use to tell us about the course. It is completely anonymous. Your identity is not recorded unless you write your name or email address in the box, so you might prefer this to email if you want to express your views without us knowing who you are. The feedback box is here: https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/communitybox/ The MSc Programme Committee The Programme Committee is a formal venue for the management of the programme, and the exchange of views between staff and student. Elected student representatives are invited, and meetings are normally held at least twice a year. We earnestly hope that students will feel able to raise problems informally (and before these meetings) so they may be dealt with as soon as possible. 3 Resolving problems promptly You can speak to a number of people if you need to get an issue resolved. For questions about the material or assessment for a particular module, contact the module leader. Their details are at the top of every DLE page. If the issue does not get resolved, you should contact your programme leader (Advanced Psychology: Dr Chris Berry; Clinical Psychology: Dr Alyson Norman), or you can contact the Lead for Taught Postgraduate Programmes, Dr Ben Whalley. You can also contact the student representative for your programme, or the Student Advocate. Clear communication It is essential that you check your university email regularly (at least once per day) in order to receive any updates from the programme team. Ensure that you let the relevant module leader know if you will miss any sessions, and keep your personal tutor informed in the unlikely event that you will be away for any significant length of time. Cancelled classes If a class has to be cancelled, we contact you as early as possible, usually via email. Sometimes lecturers become unavailable (e.g. sudden illness) without much notice. When this happens, please help us by using your own contact networks to share information with other students. We will often provide a replacement class for any that is cancelled, or rearrange teaching so that all essential material is covered. Equality and Diversity “An important part of our University is the value we place on being a diverse and inclusive community, where we learn and benefit from our rich variety of backgrounds and beliefs. This in part is why the University of Plymouth is such an enriching place to work and to study.” Professor Judith Petts CBE Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive, University of Plymouth Evidencing our commitment to equality and diversity, Plymouth holds an Athena Swan Bronze award. You can read more about our approach to equality and diversity at the university here. Contact details for the student reps will be posted on the programme DLE\nsite once they are appointed, after 30th September.↩ See the programme DLE site for more information about the programme\ncommittee.↩ "],
["communication.html", "Communication Face to face communication Email Key people/contacts Key academic and support staff Finding staff", " Communication Good communication is essential for the programme to function well. There are 2 key modes of communication used on the course: Face to face meetings during staff office hours. Email. I have a question, who should I speak to? If you have a question about the course, or an issue which needs resolving, we suggest that you: Ask your peers (e.g. through a social network, or in class). Ask the relevant module lead or project supervisor (in person or by email). If the problem is administrative in nature (e.g. module allocations) contact the faculty administrator, Karen Barnett. Contact either of the AP/CP programme leads (Chris Berry/Alyson Norman), or one of your student representatives If your problem has not been resovled, contact the lead for postgraduate programmes (Ben Whalley), the student advocate (Alastair Smith), or the Associate Head for Teaching and Learning (Jeremy Goslin). If your problem is still not resolved satisfactorily, you should consider making a complaint. See the section on complaints Face to face communication Academic staff are based in Portland Square on the second floor of A block and B block. Staff specify two ‘office hours’ during the week when they are in their offices and available to answer student queries without an appointment. Please use these office hours! Talking to us face-to-face is usually a friendlier and more efficient way of communicating than email, and students who come to our office hours tend to have a better experience. Many staff will be available to see you outside their office hours, but make an appointment first via email. All our staff are researchers and administrators as well as teachers, so please don’t be offended if you drop by unannounced and we are busy. It is anticipated that over the year an average student will see their tutor for about four to six hours during these sessions. -Find our where our offices are here As an aside, we find that students who meet regularly with academic staff during the year are often those who perform well on the degree. Don’t hide away if you have questions or are unclear on material from lectures — asking questions is the best way to learn. Email The university uses Microsoft Office 365 to provide email and many other services. These can all be accessed at: https://webmail.plymouth.ac.uk Login with your university email address, and computing account password. Using email Email is the main way in which staff in the School and the University will communicate with you. Important messages about the programme, including changes to assessments, or changes in time and location of classes or exams, will be e-mailed to you. You must check your emails regularly – at least once a day during term time. What you should expect from staff All staff aim to respond to students promptly, and always within 2 working days. You should not expect staff to respond outside of normal working hours (roughly 9am-6pm), and you should not rely on staff responding immediately when deadlines are looming. Peer/social networks or other forums might be a better bet at this point. Out of term time, if a staff member is unavailable please contact the module leader or the programme coordinator. The school office will also be able to put you in contact with available staff.

Alastair works with reps across all stages and all programmes in Psychology, including the MPsych Advanced Psychology, MPsych Clinical Psychology, BSc (Hons) Psychology and joint honours programmes, and our postgraduate Masters and DClinPsy programmes. See the having your say section and ensure your voice is heard in the running of the course. Student representatives Course representatives are the most important channels of information for your views. The representatives serve an invaluable function. We take what they say very seriously, and we directly involve them in as much decision making as possible. For example, they constitute a major voice on the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programme Committees. It is important that you use your representatives to the full. In general the representatives undertake a lot of work, much of which is unseen by the majority of students. If you have an issue you can discuss it with one of your stage representatives and they can approach a member of staff or the Programme Leader to explore what can be done about the issue. At the beginning of each academic year, students in each stage will be canvassed for volunteers to take on the role of student representative. The normal pattern is to recruit as many people as want to take on the role. The representatives for each stage then share out the responsibilities which go with the role. For example, one person might be good at organising meetings and summarising what happens at meetings whereas someone else might be better at speaking out at committees. One of the main responsibilities of the role is to communicate with the stage constituencies and to represent the views of the stage to those with operational responsibility for the programmes, usually at the Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programmes Committee. Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email. Senior Faculty Administrator Karen Barnett, K.Barnett@plymouth.ac.uk is the senior faculty administrator, and the go-to person for any issues relating to academic regulations. She will tyically be able to provide definitive answers to questions relating to deadlines, coursework submission, extenuating circumstances and much else besides.

["when-things-go-wrong.html", "When things go wrong! Let us know Extenuating circumstances (EC) Withdrawal/Suspension from a Programme Complaints", " When things go wrong! Inevitably things go wrong — perhaps because you are ill, or because some aspect of the course delivery falls short of our usual standard — but there are some important things you can do to make sure problems are resolved quickly and don’t affect your studies: Talk to your tutor or another member of staff Use the extenuating circumstances system appropriately Access the relevant university support services Let us know If you have a problem that is affecting your study it is important to let us know. Who should you speak to? Extenuating circumstances (EC) The aim of the Extenuating-Circumstances policy is to ensure you are not disadvantaged in your studies by serious, significant circumstances beyond your control. As described in the Plymouth Compass framework (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/teaching-and-learning/plymouth-university-compass), we encourage you to become a resilient and thriving individual and a competent and confident professional. This means that, while studying with us, we expect you to be able to deal with the inevitable ups and downs of life, including minor illnesses or personal issues, so that they don’t affect your studies and, in particular, your ability to attend or complete assessments. Sometimes, however, you’ll face a serious situation which has a significant impact on your ability to attend or complete assessments. The University calls such situations ‘extenuating circumstances’ (ECs). This extenuating circumstances policy describes how we can support you by taking such situations into account. The Extenuating-Circumstances policy and guidelines, and an application form, can be found here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/exams/exam-rules-and-regulations/extenuating-circumstances More detailed information is provided in the policy document here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/16/16270/Extenuating_Circumstances_Policy_and_Procedures.pdf Long-term health conditions Long term health conditions can be described as conditions which: are persistent, typically lasting for more than three months and often life-long cannot be resolved in a short time, or which will recur regardless of action, or which need to be managed on a long-term basis are a long-term or permanent illness that often results in some type of disability and which may require you to seek help with various activities can be managed but can ‘flare-up’ Examples of conditions which fall into this category are: Cystic Fibrosis, Costochondritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), Psychosis, and Bipolar Disorder. If you have a long-term health condition, you should discuss any support needs with Disability Services (or equivalent in partner institutions) before or soon after commencing your programme of study. It is hoped that the condition can be managed and / or you can be supported sufficiently by Disability Services (or its equivalent in partner institutions). https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/services/learning-gateway/disability-and-dyslexia However, there may be times when unexpected difficulties or flare-ups arise. On these occasions, you are required to claim extenuating circumstances affecting specific assessments. However, rather than requiring you to provide evidence for your condition with every extenuating circumstance claim, if you have a long-term health condition, you may wish to complete a long-term ill health form, available from the Faculty Office (or equivalent for partner institutions). This form must be accompanied by a statement from your GP, hospital consultant or appropriate specialist responsible for your treatment which provides clear confirmation of the nature, severity, duration and effect of your condition on your studies. You should submit the form to the Faculty Office for consideration. Once a claim is authorised, you will continue to be required to submit an extenuating circumstances claim for any missed assignment submission deadline, test, or examination which is directly attributable to a flare-up of your long-term health condition, but you will not be required to resubmit evidence. As a result of this process, we may need to invoke the Fitness to Study process to consider your case in more detail. You must inform your Faculty or partner institution of any change in your condition, whether improvement or deterioration, in order that the claim can be reassessed. The Faculty or partner institution may require further evidence from time to time. You will be contacted at the start of each academic year to review your case. Fitness to Study The university is committed to an ethos of equality and inclusivity, and aims to facilitate and promote positive health and wellbeing through the recognition and understanding of all relevant health conditions and disabilities. Occasionally a student’s circumstances or health may impact upon their own, or others’ ability to fulfil that potential. Levels of risk will be assessed by the university on a case-by case basis in conjunction with appropriate professionals. The Fitness to Study policy and the accompanying procedures are to be followed by Plymouth University staff where significant concerns have arisen as a result of a student’s extended absence, health condition, wellbeing or other circumstances that lead to an inability to progress in their programme, or that adversely affect others. The key purpose of the policy is to ensure that the best interests of the student are met and to provide appropriate guidance and support. Further details can be found in this link: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations Key points Apply for EC as early as possible. Retrospective applications are not normally allowed. Don’t submit coursework if you are unfit to complete it properly and plan to apply for EC. This is especially so if you have or can obtain corroborating evidence for the extenuating circumstances. Most reasonable claims are granted, but if you sit an exam or submit coursework you will be deemed to have been “fit to sit”, and thus not able to claim extenuating-circs affected your performance. Applications for EC normally require corroborating evidence, but students are allowed to self-certify (e.g. for illnesses where medical attention would not normally be sought) once in each academic year. To make an application for extenuating circumstances contact Karen Barnett directly: K.Barnett@plymouth.ac.uk, 01752 584515. Withdrawal/Suspension from a Programme There may be occasions when you decide to withdraw or interrupt your studies for certain reasons. If so, you need to consult your programme lead and seek advice. If you decide to withdraw or interrupt you must inform the programme coordinator and the faculty secretary as soon as possible. Students should be aware that there are deadlines for the full or partial refund of tuition fees. Further information is available here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations/withdrawing-from-or-suspending-study Complaints Inevitably things go wrong from time to time. As a school we pride ourselves on listening to students and resolving problems promptly. Our communications section describes how to ask questions and report problems on the course. Please follow these steps first. If you have not received a satisfactory answer, or have not recieved a response, please contact the schooladvocate, or the School Associate Head for Teaching and Learning, Phil Gee. Please only do this if you have tried emailing or meeting the member of staff responsible for the aspect of the course at issues, and have not received a response within two working days. The university also has an official complaints procedure described here, but we would expect that almost all issues can be resolved by the programme team in the first instance. Please do contact the programme lead or student advocate first. "],
["module-choices.html", "Module choices", " Module choices Prior to induction week the faculty administrator will email students with a list of options, from which they can select. This will also be provided during induction week for any students applying late. During induction week we run a number of sessions providing more information about modules, and all students need to confirm their semester-1 options within 1 week. Confirming module choices is important because it allows us to enrol you on modules on the university’s digital learning environment, which means you will get access to teaching materials and will receive email and other communications from the module leader. Changing options or modules Requests for changes to modules/options will be considered and accommodated where possible. Please make applications via email to the faculty administrator within the first two teaching weeks of each term. Where optional modules do not overlap in the timetable students are permitted to sit-in on additional classes, with the agreement of the module or programme lead. However you should be clear that you can only be enrolled on 180 credits in total, and will be required to submit CW for those modules you are enrolled on. Only modules for which you are enrolled will count towards your degree classification. Some modules contain multiple sub-options (e.g. PSYC754). Provided that space allows, and with the agreement of the option leader, it is permitted for students to attend more than one session in the first week and request to change options thereafter (although we cannot guarantee that all requests can be accommodated). Module choices for PT students. For part-time students, depending on the programme, there may sometimes be leeway when deciding which modules to take in which year. If so, consideration should be given to overall workload, and the balance of options across both years. This often means taking more credits in year 2 than 1, because PT students will be allocated a project supervisor and may complete much of the work required for the project, even though they are not officially enrolled on the project module. PT students should discuss this with their programme lead, and confirm which modules they wish to take within 1 week of the start of term. "],

All assessment on the MSc and MPsych is based upon coursework, and we have no formal examinations. Coursework is tailored to the needs of individual modules. Modules may have several coursework components which make up the total assessment. Assessment is a complex topic, but this section attempts to distill some of the key information which students need to understand how their work is assessed on the MSc and MPsych courses at Plymouth, including: ‘Level descriptors’: These are broad descriptions of what is expected from students on each type of course Learning outcomes and assessment criteria Marking schemes, grade boundaries Marking and moderation processes Summary All coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-, and all grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked. Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark which is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate courses is set at 50%. Degree classifications are slightly different depending on whether you are and MSc or MPsych student. See: MPsych classifications MSc classifications If you ever have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader to discuss it, for example during their office hours. Submitting coursework All work must be submitted via the DLE. No submissions can be accepted on paper, or via email, unless this is required to meet specific accessibility requirements. Pre-submission checklist Before submitting work, you might like to use the following checklist. ☐ Reviewed previous feedback ☐ Spell-checked manuscript ☐ Proofread/grammar-check complete ☐ Cover sheet attached ☐ Converted to PDF Coursework cover sheet The master’s coursework cover sheet is available here: masters_coursework_template.docx This coversheet includes a section in which you can write your reflections on your own work. You need to: Have a look at the grading criteria described here. Think about your work, and how it corresponds to those criteria. Think too about any previous feedback you have had and whether you have taken heed of it in the writing of the work you are to submit. Finally, explain to the marker which aspects of your work you particularly want to get feedback on. Are you worried about your essay structure? Are you unsure about how you have set out results? Do you think you’ve strongly addressed the question? Tell the marker, so that they can address these questions in their feedback. Feedback to expect Essays and practical reports include several types of feedback. General comments on the front of the work are designed to give a brief, and holistic, summary of the strong and weak points of your work. These general comments reflect the specific notes and highlights in the text where an example has been highlighted. Please read the general comments with the specific annotations in mind, and vice versa, so that you can identify some of the elements that have contributed to the overall assessment and grade, and use this feedback when reflecting on your performance on the next piece of work you submit. School style guide All coursework should be written using the coursework template provided above. This document has the correct margins, font, line spacing and so on pre-set. These requirements are also set out below which you should use unless the module leader instructs otherwise: Use Arial 12 point font Use double line spacing Use left alignment (not justified text) The top and bottom margins should be 2.5 cm. The left margin should be 1 cm and the right margin should be 4 cm. The extra space in the right margin is to allow for written feedback. Put your student number on each page (in the Header). Do not put your name on the pages. Make sure the piece of work is referenced according to the APA guidelines. Diagrams, figures and tables can be either computer generated or hand drawn and then scanned. Include diagrams and figures within the body of the assessment rather than on separate pages as appendices. Label each diagram, figure or table with a number and a clear and brief title. Page or word limits For some coursework, the module leader will specify a word limit. Where a page or word limit is specified, you must adhere to it and use the school specified format. Failure to do so may incur a mark penalty. For other coursework a module leader may instead stipulate a maximum number of pages using the School’s style guidelines. You must follow the presentation guidelines above in order to conform to the stipulated number of pages for the assessment. If you exceed this page length or you do not follow the style guidelines then your work will be penalised by the deduction of grades. The specified page limit excludes the reference list and the page reflecting on past feedback (see above). The deductions for exceeding the page limit will be applied as follows: Up to 1 page over the stipulated length: 1 grade reduction Up to 2 pages over the stipulated length: 2 grade reduction Up to 3 pages over the stipulated length: 3 grade reduction Up to 4 or more pages over the stipulated length: 4 grade reduction A one-grade reduction means, for example, that would receive a B- instead of a B. A four-grade reduction would mean that you receive a C- instead of a B. There will also be grade deductions if you submit work which does not conform to the style guidelines. Deductions will be made according to the extent of deviation from the style guidelines and the overall length of the submitted assessment. Converting work to a PDF See: How to save your work as a PDF Also: For Windows https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/400763/mod_resource/content/2/SaveToPDF%20-%20Windows.mp4 For Macs https://dle.plymouth.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/400761/mod_resource/content/2/SaveTo%20PDF%20-%20Mac.mp4 Naming files to submit You should name your file according to the following scheme: &lt;ModuleCode&gt;_&lt;SRN&gt;_&lt;AssignmentName&gt;.pdf So, for example: PSY555_12345678_Portfolio.pdf would be student 12345678’s portfolio for PSY555. Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of feedback. Coursework submission on the DLE Please note the following important points about submitting work on the DLE. When you submit work on the DLE, you may notice that you can submit multiple times. Some students find this helpful. It also allows students who are in the process of claiming extenuating circumstances (EC) to submit a draft of their work, to guard against the possibility their claim for EC is not granted. HOWEVER, this means that it is possible for you to submit work after the deadline, and you should know that if you do this without valid EC your mark will be capped at 50%. This capping occurs even if you have previously submitted a draft before the deadline, because the DLE does not record the content of this submission, and we can mark only the latest one added. Consequently, it’s extremely important for you to submit on time, and to avoid submissions after the deadline, unless you have a valid claim for EC. Problematic filenames You should name the file you submit carefully (see this), and include your student reference number in the filename. Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of feedback. Points to remember: No matter how close to a deadline, work submitted after 4.00pm will be deemed to be late. All late work carries a mark of zero. If you are prevented from submitting work on time due to medical or other extenuating circumstances. Computer-related issues (including dropped internet connections) that prevent submission of coursework cannot be considered as valid extenuating circumstances. Coursework should be submitted electronically via the relevant DLE module site. Submit a single copy on the proper coversheet, and with your student ID number printed clearly on the front page. It’s also helpful to include your student ID number in the header of subsequent pages. Your name should not appear on the coursework itself (we mark work ‘blind’, wherever this is possible, to ensure fairness) Keep an electronic copy of all your coursework until you graduate (or later, to show potential employers etc). Marking criteria and ‘credit level descriptors’ Credit level descriptors define the level of complexity, relative demand and autonomy expected of a learner on completion of a unit or programme of learning. They provide a description of levels of learning through a hierarchy of knowledge and skills, and the characteristics and context of learning expected. Specific learning outcomes and assessment criteria can be derived from level descriptors. There are 8 ‘levels’ within the scheme used in the UK 4 and masters courses, including the MSc and final year of the MPsych, are at level 7. These are organised under the following headings, and describe things that you (the learner) should demonstrate in your coursework and conduct on the course: Development of Knowledge and Understanding The Learner… Knowledge base : …has depth and systematic understanding of knowledge in specialised/applied areas and/across areas and can work with theoretical/research-based knowledge at the forefront of their academic discipline. Ethical issues : …has the awareness and ability to manage the implications of ethical dilemmas and work pro-actively with others to formulate solutions. Disciplinary methodologies : …has a comprehensive understanding of techniques/methodologies applicable to their own work (theory or research-based). Cognitive and Intellectual Skills The Learner… Analysis : …with critical awareness can undertake analysis of complex, incomplete or contradictory areas of knowledge communicating the outcome effectively. Synthesis : …with critical awareness, can synthesise information in a manner that may be innovative, utilising knowledge or processes from the forefront of the discipline/practice. Evaluation : …has a level of conceptual understanding that will allow her/him critically to evaluate research, advanced scholarship and methodologies and argue alternative approaches. Application : …can demonstrate initiative and originality in problem solving. Can act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level, making decisions in complex and unpredictable situations. Key/Transferable Skills The Learner… Group working : …can work effectively with a group as leader or member. Can clarify tasks and make appropriate use of the capacities of group members. Is able to negotiate and handle conflict with confidence. Learning resources : …is able to use full range of learning resources. Self evaluation : …is reflective on own and others’ functioning in order to improve practice. Management of information : …can competently undertake research tasks with minimum guidance. Autonomy : …is an independent and self critical learner, guiding the learning of others and managing own requirements for continuing professional development. Communications : …can engage confidently in academic and professional communication with others, reporting on action clearly, autonomously and competently Problem solving : …has independent learning ability required for continuing professional study, making professional use of others where appropriate. Practical Skills The Learner… Application of skills : … can operate in complex and unpredictable and/or specialised contexts, and has an overview of the issues governing good practice. Autonomy in skill use : …is able to exercise initiative and personal responsibility in professional practice. Technical expertise : …has technical expertise, performs smoothly with precision and effectiveness; can adapt skills and design or develop new skills and/or procedures for new situations. Level descriptors, learning outcomes and assessment criteria. There are a range of different types of assignments used on Masters’ modules. For example, your coursework might include: Oral presentations Statistical exercises Essays Grant applications Professional reports Group work Module outlines identify the learning outcomes expected of students and, when setting assessments, staff are encouraged to give clear guidance on what is required. The assessments set will relate to the learning outcomes and enable you to demonstrate the abilities described in the level descriptors. Categorical and percentage grades Across the school, all coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-. Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark (see table) which is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate courses is set at 50% Letter grade % A+ 100 A 88 A- 77 B+ 68 B 65 B- 62 C+ 58 C 55 C- 52 D+ 48 D 45 D- 42 F+ 38 F 25 F- 15 Our experience is that using categorical grades helps markers to remember to use the full range of the marking scale. When using only percentage marks, markers are often reluctant to award marks over 90%, for example. Using the full range of the scale helps us identify and reward students achieving at a very high level. Standards expected Mapping between level descriptors and grade boundaries can be challenging for students, and so we find that it is useful to provide a general guide as to the standards expected for work at each level of attainment on the MSc and MPsych degrees. Note that although different terminology is used (e.g. Distinction vs. First class award) the boundaries for these award categories overlap across the programmes Distinction (MSc) or First class award (MPsych): &gt;=70%, grades A- to A+ At this level students should submit work which is: Comprehensive and accurate coverage of relevant material. Demonstrates critical evaluation; clarity of argument; integration of material. Insight into theoretical issues and, where appropriate, Originality in exposition and treatment. There should be only very minor omissions, inaccuracies, or defects of presentation. Merit (MSc) or 2:1 (MPsych): 60-69%, grades B- to B+ Students will produce work that is: Accurate, relevant and informed, with good insight Shows only minor omissions and inaccuracies May include less comprehensive theoretical analysis than merits a distinction. Pass (MSc) or 2:2 (MPsych): 50%-59%, grades C- to C+) Coursework will be Generally accurate, relevant and well informed. Reasonably comprehensive Well organised and structured. Have generally clear presentation, with some critical evaluation and understanding shown. However work may also have: Some omissions and errors. Limited understanding or errors in some places. Arguments which are not fully developed, or which fail to address the question. Fail (&lt; 50%, grades D+ and below) Fails to address question or purpose of assessment directly 5 Provides cursory coverage of relevant material. Contains significant inaccuracies. Arguments poorly developed Assertions unsupported by evidence. Poor organisation and style. Marking of presentations Presentations are typically given twice (to separate markers) or recorded for seond marking to take place. This is an example of a presentation marking proforma, which indicates the characteristics markers will be looking for: Referencing guidelines The school requires all coursework to conform to the APA style manual, version 6. 6 The library has prepared a useful guide for citing and referencing in APA style: Library APA referencing guide Writing in APA style is simple but highly valued by many markers. Failure to comply with the rules will cause you to recieve negative feedback and poorer marks. The BPS styleguide is an excellent resource for writing and editing, and uses the APA rules as a basis for it’s recommendations, but adds much more. BPS Style guide (pdf) Unless other instructions are explicitly given by the module leader, you should fully reference each piece of coursework. Do not provide a bibliography in place of a reference list. Do not omit the reference list. However, the reference list does not contribute to the page count for the assessment Marking and grading All grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked, which involves the following steps: Peer moderation : The first marker (normally the person who set the work) provides a small sample of coursework to a colleague for independent second marking, normally 6 scripts. The two markers compare the grades they have awarded to this sample and discuss any inconsistencies. Once satisfied that marks are being awarded consistently and at the correct level, the first marker continues to mark coursework from the rest of the cohort in the same fashion. Second marking : This applies primarily to project reports. Here the first marker provides feedback for the student, and awards a grade. A second marker also reads the report and awards a second independent mark. Both markers meet to discuss the grade, and where inconsistencies arise these are resolved by discussion, or with reference to the programme leader if no agreement can be found (this is rare). External examiners : In addition, all coursework and marking is validated by our external examiner — an independent academic from a different university appointed to uphold standards on our degree programmes. The external examiner will check samples of coursework from across the degree to ensure standards are properly applied, work is marked fairly and that suitable feedback is provided. For this reason, grades awarded during the year are not final and may be subject to amendment by subject examination committees. Queries about grades awarded The grade awarded is holistic in that it reflects the entire assignment. This lots of little details and elements of style and construction within. That means that no particular item, such as an argument or a table, has an overwhelming effect on the mark. Instead it is the overall sum of these elements, plus how the assignment is put together, that determine a grade that best represents the overall quality of the submission. If you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected provided we are made aware of the problem. If you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, or feedback that has been provided, then in the first instance please contact the module leader to discuss it (e.g. during their office hours). It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately. Anonymous marking The University has a clear preference for marking of coursework to be anonymous wherever possible. In brief the policy states: Anonymous assessment should ensure summative assessments are marked as far as possible and where appropriate without the student’s name or identity being made known to the marker or subject assessment panel. Anonymity provides reassurance for students and assessors against the perception of discrimination and bias entering the assessment process, and aims to ensure all students are treated equally. Anonymous assessment should not impede rapid feed forward and feedback to students. The full policy is available here: https://goo.gl/8nZx69 Feedback Feedback is information and advice, either to guide your work-in-progress, or help you reflect on work already completed. Feedback is probably the most important thing that your teachers at Plymouth provide; it forms an integral part of the learning process. Your job, if you’re not already an expert, is to learn how to use feedback effectively. Types of feedback In educational jargon, we provide two types of feedback throughout the course: Formative feedback : This is to help guide and improve your work in progress. This can come in a wide variety of guides: from peers, informal conversations, in-class-quizz’s, discussions of your work plans, or on feedback on your submitted work, where this can be used to inform future work. Summative feedback : This usually comes at the end of a module: for example when you submit coursework and recieve a grade summarising your performance on the module as a whole (i.e. a grade). Formative feedback is by far the most important Students often focus on the grade awarded to their coursework, for obvious reasons. However, this is a mistake because the grade itself: provides no information about why work has been awarded the mark and therefore provides very little information about to guide your future future work Only formative feedback provides oppportunities for action and learning. Types of feedback to expect We provide many different ways for students to get feedback on their work, including: Annotations on written work (highlights, stamps, comments) General comments on the front of written work which summarise and contextualise the specific example annotations Generic feedback, provided to the whole cohort, describing things that differentiated strong and weak essays, reports, and exams Verbal feedback in tutorials, tutor meetings, TARA surgeries, and follow-up meetings with module leaders or staff who set assessments Using feedback effectively This section is adapted from Race, 2007, which has many other excellent tips for using feedback effectively. The Working out what written feedback really means! section is particularly enlightening. Take a deep breath. Criticism of our work – even when it is constructive and sensitively written – can elicit strong emotional reactions, and make it harder to learn. It’s perfectly natural to try to protect yourself from the hurt of critical feedback, but the problem then is that this interferes with the flow of critical feedback to you. The more you can gently probe for even more feedback, the more useful the feedback turns out to be. Focus on positives as well as the negatives. Some students skip over praise or other positive comments because they think them less important. But positive comments can help place other suggestions in context, and make them easier to swallow… and you need to keep doing the good things too, so don’t neglect the positives. Ask questions. If you don’t understand something then do talk to your fellow students, compare notes, or email the marker or module leader. Use office hours to discuss feedback (bring a copy of the work and feedback to discuss). See Race, 2007 for other useful suggestions for approaching lecturers. Summarise the feedback in your own words. Make sure all the points make sense to you, and that you can relate them to the work you did. Make a plan. Each time you recieve feedback, make a plan for how you will use this to improve your work next time. Taking the time to think of concrete, actionable steps will make it easier to integrate feedback with your work when you are up against the next deadline. Keep a copy of your feedback (and your summaries and plans). A study journal or ‘blog’ type format can work well. Reflect back over past feedback often and try to spot patterns. When will I get feedback? Marked coursework will be returned via the DLE, within 20 working days of submission. If there is a reason for a delay you will be informed; if you notice a delay, please inform the programme lead. Results When do I get my results? At the end of the academic year, the assessment panel meets to confirm marks for each module. You will then receive a statement of your results in July (a letter) and a transcript of your results will be posted on the DLE. What happens if I fail an assessment? The rules which decide what happens if you fail an assessment are quite complex, but the important facts are: The pass-mark for all masters programmes is 50%. If you don’t submit an assignment you will get a mark of zero. If you fail an assessment you may be required to resit some or all of the CW on that module. Marks for repeated coursework are normally capped at 50% (except where extenuating circumstances apply). All marks awarded are provisional until they have been confirmed by the Award Assessment Board (in June/July). If you have questions about assessments and progression on a module please contact the school administrator, Karen Barnet. How many times can I resit an assessment? Unless there have been exceptional circumstances, you are only permitted to resit on one occasion. Relevant university regulations The University has many complex rules and regulations which relate to postgraduate and undergraduate-masters programmes. Most of the time you will not need to study the detail of these. However, a copy of the Plymouth University regulatory framework for taught post-graduate awards is available online at: https://goo.gl/7uE51O A copy of the Plymouth University regulatory framework for taught post-graduate awards is available online at: https://goo.gl/7uE51O. However, if you have a question about the regulations it might be better to contact Karen Barnet in the first instance. The university also publishes an A-Z guide to terms used around the university, which might be useful in this context. You can access this here: https://goo.gl/GfFUBQ Prizes &amp; Awards School prizes The School of Psychology awards various prizes for academic achievement at the end of each academic year. The decision to award a prize is taken by the Award Assessment Board and their decision is final. You will be informed if you have won a prize. For level 7 (masters students) the relevant prizes are for: Best project Highest achieving student (i.e. best aggregate mark at level 7) The Plymouth Award The ‘Plymouth Award’ is a University-wide scheme designed to recognise the extra-curricular achievements of our students, pulling an individual’s life-wide experiences together into a portfolio of experience, reflections and learning outcomes. We know that our students are involved in a wide range of activities and we want to enhance and celebrate these achievements. Participants are required to carry out a minimum number of hours of activity from no less than three out of five key strands, and to complete this over the duration of their studies. A final award will be made to the student at the time of graduating. The strands of activity include: Personal health and well being Working life Volunteering Cultural and social awareness Supporting the University community For further details please visit the Plymouth Award website: (www.plymouth.ac.uk/plymouthaward) Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, collusion, cheating in exams and fabricating data. These practices and others related to dishonesty probably constitute the dirtiest words in academia, and they are quite properly punished severely where they are detected and proved. It is your job to familiarise yourself with the rules on plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Ignorance of the rules and expectations is not an excuse. University rules on AD The University has very strict regulations about academic dishonesty. You will need to know what counts as academic dishonesty according to the university regulations and make sure you avoid committing any action which could be construed as dishonest. Below is a list of practices which the University has identified as common instances of dishonesty. (these examples are not necessarily exhaustive). Obtaining or attempting to obtain access to an unseen examination or test paper prior to the start of the examination/test. The introduction or use in an examination/test of any books, notes, paper or devices of any kind other than those specifically permitted in the rubric of the paper. Failing to comply with the instructions of an invigilator or examiner, or with the printed instructions for candidates. Removing from an examination or test any script, paper, or other official stationery (whether or not completed) unless specifically authorised by an invigilator or examiner. Being party to any arrangement whereby a person other than the candidate fraudulently represents, or intends to represent, the candidate in an examination or test (personation). Communicating, or attempting to communicate with another student or with any third party other than the invigilator/examiner during an examination or test. Use of crib sheets, revision notes etc at any time during an examination or test. Copying or attempting to copy the work of another student, whether by overlooking his/her work, asking him/her for information, or by any other means. The submission for assessment of material (written, computer-generated, visual or oral) originally produced by another person or persons, without indicating that the material is not original, such that the work could be assumed to be the student’s own. The unauthorised use of the work of another student (whether by taking a hard copy without permission or through access to an electronic copy). The representation of work produced in collaboration with another person or persons as the work of a single candidate. The inclusion in a piece of assessed work (other than an examination or in-class/end-module test) of material which is identical or substantially similar to material which has already been submitted for any other assessment within the University. Making false declarations in an attempt to obtain special examination arrangements or special consideration (e.g. of extenuating circumstances). The presentation of data in laboratory work, projects etc based on work purporting to have been carried out by the student but which has been invented, copied, altered or otherwise falsified. Attempting to persuade another member of the University (student, staff, or invigilator) to participate in any way in actions which would be in breach of this Regulation. Being party to any arrangement which would constitute a breach of this Regulation. Plagiarism Plagiarism is one of the commonest forms of academic dishonesty; it isessentially copying or closely paraphrasing the work of another personwithout clearly indicating what has been copied or the source of thecopying. With the ready availability of the internet and the increasingaccess to on-line resources, it has become ever easier to commitplagiarism. The counter point to this trend is that with moresophisticated computer programmes and internet search engines, it isactually becoming more easy to detect plagiarism. As well as cases where an individual student has intentionally set out to deceive the marker, it is not uncommon for students to commit some form of plagiarism but be unaware that they have committed an offence. In these circumstances, the most common mistakes are for students to: Paraphrase the original source too closely Paraphrase the original source too closely by changing the grammar or individual words of the original only slightly. Even though the student’s work is not a direct quote it is still copying the ideas and expression of those ideas too closely. Solution: make sure you paraphrase key ideas from a source entirely in your own words. Using notes directly Making notes from a source (journal or book) which is a copy the original and then forgetting that your notes are a copy. When you come to write your assessment what you have in your notes sounds good so you use that material in your essay. However what you have put into your essay is a direct quote or a close paraphrase of the original. Even though the student may claim that they did not intend to commit plagiarism, such cases will still be treated as plagiarism and punished accordingly. Solution: When you write notes from another source always make your notes clear about what the source is and what is a quote or close paraphrase. The use of direct quotations The use of direct quotations or lightly paraphrased text without citing the source would be deemed to be an assessment offence. Where work was similarly presented, without quotation marks, but with a clear indication of the source this would be identified as bad practice and marked accordingly. In the latter case, overly-derivative work showing little intellectual input from the student would be likely to be given a low mark, and if extensive the work would be almost certain to fail. Solution: If you must quote a source put the quote in quotation marks and reference it correctly both in the body of the essay and in the full reference list. It is however better to synthesise the ideas and put them into your own words. You will still need to reference the source of the ideas.   Preventing academic dishonesty Everyone involved in higher education is responsible for preventing the incidence of academic dishonesty. Prime responsibility rests with students themselves. You can help reduce the incidence of academic dishonesty through following these points of principle: Be organised in your work Students committing academic dishonesty often claim that time pressures and last minute panic led them to cheat. Such panic might be a reason for cheating but it does not excuse it. You can reduce the likelihood of such pressures by being organised, knowing what assessment deadlines you have to meet, and planning your work accordingly. If you are not a good organiser, take advice. Advice is available from your personal tutor, from study skills courses run by the University and from your network of friends and colleagues. Know the rules It is tremendously important to know what counts as academic dishonesty. One problem is of course that there is no hard and fast cut off between honesty and dishonesty; there are gradations between best practice and utterly dishonest practice. It is essential that you get a sense of where the boundary lies on this gradation. In Stage 1, this topic will be discussed as one of the tutorial topics. There are also exercises available on the student portal which aim to help you understand where this boundary lies. Sometimes students plead that ignorance of the rules led them to cheat. Again this ignorance may be a reason for cheating, but it does not excuse it. Don’t ignore dishonest practice There are occasions where you suspect a fellow student of committing academic dishonesty. The most common form of this practice occurs where another student uses or copies your work without your permission. If you suspect that someone is cheating in this way, then you can talk to your personal tutor, the relevant marker, the relevant module leader, the stage tutor or programme co-ordinator all in confidence. If your suspicion is well founded then the member of staff will take steps to detect the cheating without involving you directly. Be aware of detection systems The School of Psychology has systems for checking work submitted for assessments and detecting academic dishonesty. The marker is obviously in a good position to detect cheating such as plagiarism. The School may also ask a randomly selected sample of students to submit electronic copies of their assessment after the deadline has passed. These copies will be subjected to plagiarism detection software which compares the content of essays with that of other student essays and with text on web sites and in journals and books. By being able to match the content of the essay with these different sources, this software now has a very high detection rate for plagiarism. Consequences of academic dishonesty If a marker believes your assessment shows signs of cheating, then the university procedures will be followed. When the student has been informed by the module leader that he or she is suspected of an offence under the university regulations, then they will have an opportunity to discuss this charge with the module leader. The student then has to decide whether to accept the charge or contest it in front of a faculty committee. If a student is found guilty of academic dishonesty then they will be punished, usually as a minimum by having the grade for the work submitted or the module as a whole reduced to zero. Every year, a number of students have their marks reduced and fail the modules concerned. If you have your marks reduced to zero because of academic dishonesty then the impact on your overall mark profile and your eventual degree classification can be high. The information will be kept on your academic file, and may be referred to by your tutor or other member of staff when writing a reference for you after you leave the University. A second offence may lead to removal of the student from their programme of study. See the\nSEEC level descriptors document↩ This is\nincredibly common in the work of weaker students, and failing to address the\nquestion as posed is probably the primary cause of work being awarded a\nlow-pass or fail.↩ see also https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/↩ "],

Note that your timetable might take a few days to settle down if you were late in choosing your module options. A copy of the programme timetable (including all modules) is available on the programme site as a backup if you are stuck. It is vital that you check your timetable in the first weeks of term. You should particularly check you registered on all the correct modules and for the current year. If you spot any inconsistencies please email Karen Barnett or contact the programme lead. This is very important because module registrations on the DLE are used for group-emails and notifications, and so you may miss important info if your registrations are incorrect. The Academic year 2020-21 The University year is organised by week numbers which are assigned primarily for the purposes of undergraduate teaching and so can sometimes be confusing for MSc students. It’s worth noting here that: The year is organised into two semesters. Vacation periods are not part of the semesters, although they interrupt them. 2020-2021 university calendar . "],

PsySoc A message from the Chair: “PsySoc was founded at the end of 2006 by students who felt that there was a real gap for a society where Psychology students from all years could meet each other, socialise and learn from each other’s experiences. It was in this mind that we decided that PsySoc would provide traditional social get-togethers, but also some academic activities such as guest lecturers, book sales, and support. PsySoc aims to provide an outlet for all students to get together and enjoy each other’s company, be it in an academic or social setting, and our committee works hard to make sure that this happens. We do have a FaceBook site, and we will be making ourselves known throughout the year, so there is plenty of opportunity to join us in whatever capacity you feel is right for you, from helping out other students, attending guest lectures or just joining us on a social. However much you want to join in, PsySoc provides the opportunity to meet other psychology students from all years, and from all backgrounds.” https://www.upsu.com/societies/6833/ Visas and international Tier 4 visa Some international students will require Tier 4 visas to study in the UK. The UKBA (United Kingdom Border Agency) has issued new requirements for students with a Tier 4 student visa: The University must retain copies of the personal identity pages of your passport plus pages covering your current leave and all UK leave stamps, and a copy of the Identity Card for Foreign Nationals (if applicable). These documents must be copied before your faculty enrolment is completed. Details of scanning points on campus will be circulated. Records of attendance must be kept for all students with a Tier 4 student visa applied for with a CAS (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies ) number. You will be asked to swipe your Plymouth University ID card in the reception of ISAS (16 Portland Villas) every 2 weeks during term time. It is important to keep your faculty or ISAS notified of any periods of non-attendance , perhaps due to absence from Plymouth or illness etc. You will be contacted if you miss more than 2 consecutive swipes. You must maintain up-to date personal contact details on the student portal at all times. Please note: the university must report to the UKBA: A specified period of non-attendance If you cease to study at the university for any reason (withdrawals, suspensions, interruptions etc) If your study circumstances change such as a change in course, or if the duration of your course changes. If it is known that you are not complying with the conditions of your leave Please see ISAS (International Student Advisory Service) to discuss or clarify any of the points above. ISAS: Roland Levinsky Gateway: international.advice@plymouth.ac.uk, &lt;www.plymouth.ac.uk/isas&gt; Campus Maps Campus Map Health and Safety The primary responsibility for your safety and your health lies with yourself. The University, Faculty and School publish Safety handbooks which are available online through the portal. These provide guidance on safe working practices and specific risks which you may encounter. Covid-19 It is imperative that the current university guidelines are followed: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/about-us/covid-19 Fire In the event of a fire alarm sounding you must leave the building by the nearest available main exit. If your route to a main exit is obstructed then you should evacuate by way of the next available fire exit. When the alarm sounds you must stop what you are doing immediately, even if you are in the middle of an experiment you must stop. If you are a researcher running an experiment then you should make sure that your participant(s) respond to the alarm. Do not use the lifts or re-enter the building until the all clear is given by a fire marshal (wearing a yellow tabbard) General Hazards The responsible safety manager is Professor Tim Hollins, as Head of School. Safety coordination within the School is delegated to the Technical Manager, Anthony Mee. Any concerns about safety should be communicated to Anthony in the Technical Office, Room Link 109. If you become aware of any hazard or broken equipment this should be reported immediately to the Technical Office. Health If you make extensive use of computers you should familiarise yourself with advice available online regarding posture and working position. In general laptops are poorly designed for extensive periods of use and desktop screens should be adjusted to be at eye level. If you suffer from any condition requiring medication or reducing your mobility please make sure that those around are aware and know what to do in the event of an emergency. Security staff are all trained first aiders, and in the Link block Lynne James in the Technical Office is also a First Aider. Lone Working Students are not allowed to remain in the Labs after 5pm unless accompanied by a member of staff. Undergraduates should never work alone with public participants.

["advanced-psychology.html", "Advanced Psychology Course aims Research project Writing up your project", " Advanced Psychology Overview (MSc and MPsych) Students on the AP awards gain in-depth and highly specialised expertise with cutting edge theory and methods in their area of interest, using elective modules to tailor their path through the programme to their chosen specialty, undertaking novel research, and extending the boundaries of current knowledge under the guidance of experts. Programme lead Dr Chris Berry I have been a Lecturer at University of Plymouth, School of Psychology since 2012. I am the lead for the MPsych and MSc Advanced Psychology programmes as well as module leader for several modules. My research interests include human memory, particularly the relation between memory and awareness. I use mathematical modelling techniques to test different theories. Further details of my research and teaching can be found here. Course aims A thorough, experientially-based training in psychological research methods. Through core modules in advanced research methods students on all programmes will gain a secure understanding of the theory, application and limitations of quantitative statistical methods for experimental and observational data. Enhanced emphasis will be placed on fluency in data manipulation and visualisation, and in developing insight and understanding for the ways in which assumptions and theory form the basis on which statistics can be used for scientific inference. Specialist techniques (e.g. Bayesian inference, approaches to causal analysis in non-experimental data) will be offered as options, to ensure students can extend this conceptual understanding with practical experience applying specific techniques required in particular research domains. Advanced, training in theoretical and empirical advances in cognitive and brain science, behaviour change, or clinical psychology. Through the “current issues” and “foundations of clinical psychology” modules students will develop awareness and understanding of new research questions, debates and findings in their chosen field. Elective modules will enable students to extend this knowledge, tailoring their learning according to their specific interests. These modules are cross-cutting in nature, designed to integrate multiple research perspectives and prove relevant in different combinations for a variety of students. For example, modules such as The Brain and its Disorders enable students to explore in detail current knowledge of specific conditions, providing a secure grounding in the neuroscience of clinical approaches to schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and dementia. Deep and thorough conceptual understanding of chosen areas of study All aspects of these programmes aim towards deepening conceptual understanding of the theoretical, empirical, and methodological advances in their field. Students’ achievements on each module will be assessed entirely through coursework, which will provide a stimulus and opportunity for them to critically evaluate the material covered, to apply it to new problems, and to develop new ideas for future research. Professionalism and professional identity For all programmes, we shall organise the academic year such that students are encouraged to think of psychological research and practice as an iterative, cyclical process involving: enquiry, design, technique, communication, practice, and reflection. Students will be encouraged to reflect on their learning regularly throughout the year, and tutorial activities will ensure this is integrated within their own research practice. The work undertaken in all modules aims to develop students’ critical understanding of research methodology, and apply it to the design of their own research projects. Research project The project counts for 60 credits out of a total of 180 for the MSc AP as a whole, or 60 out of 120 credits for the MPsych AP, and is thus a very substantial piece of work. The ability of students to conduct and report a major piece of research work is of central importance. Students should be aware that the quality of the project work will be ofconsiderable interest to potential employers, PhD supervisors etc., with whom they may wish to work on completion of this degree. Project work has a large bearing on the reference given and potential employers may ask to see a copy of the project report. Approval of project topics and allocation of supervisors will be the responsibility of the Programme directors. In order to maximise the range of possible research topics, supervision may be arranged with any full-time member of staff of the School, not just those teaching on the programme. Points and participant payments AP students are given 40 points within our research participation pool. More information (user guides) is available here: http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/ If you would like to participate in other students experiments, please contact pointsadmin@psy.plymouth.ac.uk AP students also have a project budget of £120 which can be used to pay participants. You must discuss this spending with your supervisor first. The relevant forms to complete are then: AP project costing form (docx) Participant payment form (docx) Ethics All student projects must be approved by the faculty ethical committee before data collection begins, using the online system at https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/SOPEthics/Login. Where ethical approval is not required for a particular project, students must arrange for their supervisor to email the programme lead explaining why this is the case (e.g. project is a meta-analysis) to obtain a waiver. Failing to obtain ethical clearance or a waiver will cause you to fail the module. NHS ethics Students wishing to run projects based in the NHS will also need ethical clearance from the appropriate NHS ethics committee. Students wishing to run projects involving children will also need clearance from the Criminal Records Bureau. This may cause delay, so submission for ethical clearance well before the project planning deadline is recommended. Work with children or vulnerable adults Research with children recruited through specific institutions (e.g., Schools) will need, in additional to the ethical clearance from the School, the approval of the authorities in charge of the institution, the approval of parents. Projects involving children, vulnerable adults or NHS patients will also require clearance from the Criminal Record Bureau. This procedure can take several months. Supervision Students are expected to make to regular contact with their assigned supervisor and may be penalised if they run work which has not been approved. Supervisory contact is required for the following purposes: Advising on the literature review - although responsibility for detailed searches lies with the student Advising on and approving the design of the empirical work Advising on and approving the method of analysis to be used Advising on the interpretation of findings and the plan for the final report. The supervisor must not be asked to comment on drafts of the report itself which they will be responsible for marking together with a second independent marker. See also ‘conduct of the student’ below. Supervision out of term time Staff are not guaranteed to be on campus after the end of year period on the university calendar and the School cannot guarantee availability of supervision after this date (during the summer vacation). For this reason it is effectively a requirement that the empirical phase of the project work be completed by this date. It is strongly recommended also that students produce and agree with their supervisors a plan for the final report by the same date. School Resources Bookable labs There are a range of bookable lab cubicles for individual or pairs of participants. These include: Dedicated staff labs. These facilities are open to postgraduate use through the staff research groups who use them. Facilities include ERP Lab (101), Baby Lab (208), Soft Lab (209), Well-being Lab (210), EMG Psycho-physical Lab (213), Eye tracker Lab (214), Vision Specialist Labs (215), Audiology Lab (216), VR Lab (217) The observation labs (203 &amp; 205) Labs capable of running five to eight simultaneous participants. From October - March there can be quite high demand for labs and we implement the following measures to ensure fair access for all: You can only book 3.75 hours a day, which can’t span lunch. Sessions end and key cards must be returned at 12:45 for the morning and 16:45 for the afternoon. You must obtain ethical clearance before booking lab time. Experimental software/hardware The Technical Office can write custom applications and produce special hardware to fill most experimental requirements – contact the technical manager for more information. If requesting the tech office write software for your experiment, we strongly recommend that you: Specify what you want to appear on screen in as much detail as possible, including mockups in power point and with list Specify exactly how you want the data to be recorded, and what variables should be saved Test the software thoroughly before using with participants. This should involve a complete run-through of the experiment followed by an attempt to analyse the resulting data. It is only by attempting to analyse the data saved that many problems can be identified. It can also help to create a paper prototype and test this with other students before sending the spec to the tech office11. Borrowing Equipment There is a selection of equipment available for loan from the Technical Office, including computers, cassette recorders, stopwatches etc. If you intend to remove the equipment from the campus then a loan form must be signed, as equipment is not insured when off campus. A note on security: All rooms containing equipment must be left locked whenever the room is left unattended even if this is only for a short period. If you are the last person to leave a laboratory it is your responsibility to ensure that it is locked, the technicians in room 109 will always have a key. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the computer labs are not left unlocked when there is nobody using them. Conduct and contribution of the student Our aim is that masters projects represent a substantial piece of research, which makes a novel and publishable contribution to the literature. This requirement usually dictates that students will work collaboratively with their supervisor, and both will contribute to the final design and analysis of the study. That is, projects are unlikely to be a truly independent piece of research. As a consequence, we do not customarily make detailed accounting of students’ contribution to projects and try to adjust marks accordingly. The reason is that it is not possible to devise a fair scheme to compensate students for their relative contributions to projects when the different facts of this contribution are not necessarily commensurable. However, we do provide second markers with information about your conduct during the design, running and analysis of the project, and our policy is to use this information where i) the work appears to sit at the threshold between two grade points or ii) to resolve discrepancies between the first and second marker. Thus, a student who submits a manuscript on the borderline between a grade of B+ and A-, but who made a substantial contribution to the design and development of their project, would be awarded the higher of these two grades. To reassure students who are engaging in detailed conversations regarding the design and analysis of their projects: this is both normal an expected. You will not be penalised for this because it is a normal part of science to collaborate with other researchers. Only where such help is deemed excessive, or the student overly-dependent on supervisory assistance would this become an issue, and your supervisor will discuss this with you should this uncommon situation arise. Publication of Projects Project work should be potentially of publishable standard. Although it is not formally required, we wish strongly to encourage the submission of project work for publication and offer some advice in this section. It will rarely be the case that a project report - however highly marked - will be suitable for submission as a journal article without alteration. Students should therefore consult closely with their supervisor about the amendments needed prior to submission. Since this will occur after the examination process, supervisors will be free to advise in detail and to contribute themselves to the write-up. The authorship of publications arising from projects would normally be joint between the student and supervisor with the student’s name appearing first. This is the default recommended since it is required that the student substantially contribute to design of the project as well as conduct the work, and hence merit first authorship. The level of supervisory input also expected, however, would usually imply justification for the supervisor as second author. Where a project needs considerable rewriting for publication which the student lacks time or skill to complete this, it may be agreed that the supervisor completes the write-up and appears as first author. If a student has not written up their research within two years, then the supervisor may use the research in publications, with themselves as first author and the student as co-author. Any student who succeeds in publishing a project, even if some time after leaving Plymouth, is requested to inform the Psychology modular masters co-ordinator and send a copy of the paper. Writing up your project I have already made this paper too long, for which I must crave pardon, not having now time to make it shorter. Benjamin Franklin, 1750 The Master’s project is a substantial piece of work, and should be reflected in the care and attention given to the reporting of your results. However, the length of research reports is not a reliable indicator of the effort required to produce it, nor of it’s quality. To communicate your findings, we recommend that you identify a suitable high-impact psychological journal and organise your manuscript according to their authors instructions. Examples of suitable journals might include Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, or Qualitative Psychology. This will almost always produce a manuscript which has the follwing sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion Most journals will accept manuscripts in the region of 4,500 to 6,500 words with a maximum of around 5 tables and 5 figures, and with around 250 words allowed for the abstract. The upper limit for masters dissertations is 10,000 words, excluding tables and references. However we suggest that you aim to keep your report closer to the limits imposed by the major journals, unless there are specific reasons why a longer report is desireable, and you have agreed this with your supervisor. Where a project is overly long, or lacks precision in the writing, then this will be marked down accordingly. To be clear: there is an upper limit of 10,000 words that will only be appropriate in a few cases. Almost all reports will be between 4,500 and 6,500 words, varying with the nature of the project. If in doubt, check with your supervisor. Use of appendices Appendices should not become a dumping ground, and should only include information necessary for the scientific understanding of your work. Examples of things which should not be included in an appendix: Illustration of the primary task used (e.g., screen capture or diagram). This should be a figure in the main report, or you should simply cite the original paper describing the task. Where a task has many variants which might interest a reader but which aren’t central to communicating the findings, however, they might be included in an appendix. A copy of the participant consent form with signatures from all participants. Brief and debrief SPSS printouts. All relevant statistical results must be reported in the Results section, in the format prescribed by the American Psychological Association in their Publication Manual. Questionnaires. If using your own questionnaire or a questionnaire that is not protected by copyright, report it in a Table. If using a questionnaire protected by copyright, or a measure which is widely used and described in a another publication, you must make sure that your method section gives a good description of what the questionnaire assessed and how it was structured but you should not report the items. You must also make sure that you cite the source of the questionnaire. Typography and layout There is no page limit for the project, but please: Include a standard cover sheet. Use a 12 point font Use double line spacing (tables may be left singlespaced) Leave at least 4cm in the right hand margin You should include a title page with the following information: Title of the study The text “Thesis submitted to the University of Plymouth for the [MSc/MPsych in ___] by [your name]”, and the year at the bottom of the page. Next should be a page on which you copy the following text: “The work reported in this thesis received ethical approval from the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences and complies with the guidelines set by the British Psychological Society.” On this page you can also include acknowledgements (thank people who helped you get through your project and add any comment you see fit). On the next page would be your actual report. References should start on a page of their own. Figures and tables should be placed at relevant locations within the text and clearly labelled and numbered. Don’t copy them all to the end of the manuscript. Contribution of the student Second markers will be given information about the conduct and contribution of students. This should not be used for the routine adjustment of marks ( e.g. higher marks for larger student contributions) but instead should be used to disambiguate work near grade boundaries, or to resolve discrepancies between markers. Expectations of AP projects The design and analysis of AP student projects should reflect the extended coverage given to methods in the course. Projects need not demonstrate competence in every technique covered but – where relevant – reports should demonstrate students’ awareness of key concepts and handle data accordingly. Key concepts include: Statistical power Statistical inference and causation Pitfalls of null hypothesis significance testing Handling repeated measures data Missing data Issues in qualitative data analysis Where AP students propose a project that requires only very simple analysis (e.g. pairwise correlations or simple t-tests) this may be appropriate if the project is methodologically demanding in other areas (e.g. recruitment, complexity of data acquisition), or where this is based on the recommendation of the supervisor. However it is generally expected that AP projects will be more methodologically ambitious than undergraduate projects or MSc/PGDiP projects, and markers will normally award the highest marks only where this is the case. Project marking All projects are double-marked by supervisors and another academic within the school. Where a fail grade is given by one or both markers, then a third marker will also assess the work. The normal guidelines for marking within the school apply. Indicative grades A mark of 50-59% or more indicates competent work of masters standard; a mark of 60-69% indicates work at the merit level and a mark of 70% or more indicates work at distinction level. For all masters courses, the pass mark is 50%. Below are the characteristics of report which markers will use to determine your grade: Introduction : The introduction should show: - Range, relevance and quality of understanding shown in the student’s reading of literature. - Organisation and quality of the prose. You should aim to be concise and precise throughout the report. - Clarity of the exposition of the rationale for the study, and the linkage with the literature review. NOTE: Because the project report should be modelled on the form of a journal article, introductions should be focused on specific aims and not contain detailed reviews of literature not directly relevant to the study. Method : The methods section should demonstrate - Quality of the design and relevance to the objectives of the study. - Level of ambition in terms of both the scale of the study and the relative complexity of the methodology employed. This will vary between programmes, and markers will take account of the time available to complete the project: MPsych projects will typically be the simplest, because of time constraints; MSc PRM projects will be the most methodologically ambitious. - Competence and thoroughness in the conduct of the study. - Presentation of the method section in terms of clarity, organisation, thoroughness and concision. You should present all details necessary to replicate the study, but not more. Results : Results sections should evidence - Quality, competence, appropriateness, and thoroughness of the analysis of data. - Organisation and clarity of the presentation of results. - Appropriateness and quality of presentation of graphs, figures and tables. Discussion : A discussion should show: - Clear exposition of the findings. - Understanding and interpretation of the findings. - Critical appraisal of the study and its methodology. - Discussion of broader theoretical implications in the context established by the introduction. - Quality of presentation of arguments; organisation, style and clarity. Data sharing and research transparency All of the data you collect should be submitted alongside your project report, unless specifically agreed with your supervisors and the programme lead in advance (for example, because of practical or ethical constraints). These data should be documented, such that other researchers could replicate your analysis if required. More guidance will be given throughout the project planning and project modules, but as a minimum we would expect AP students to submit: Raw datafiles in csv or other appropriate format Code to combine/process data into an ‘analysable data file’ - normally a csv The analysable file itself In addition, it is increasingly becoming the norm to submit code for the analyses you report alongside your data, for example using R or RMarkdown files. Qualitative projects For projects employing qualitative or interpretative methods, special ethical conditions may apply — for example to audio or transcript data. This may prevent putting all data in the public domain. However you should aim to: Secure consent from participants to share anonymised transcript data. Share anonymised transcripts, as far as this is ethical/practical. Share details of intermediate analyses, e.g. using software such as NVivo. See\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping↩ "],
["clinical-psychology.html", "Clinical Psychology Course aims Disclosure and Barring Service Checks Research project Writing up your project", " Clinical Psychology Overview (MSc and MPsych) The MSc Clinical Psychology (CP) forms part of four, interlinked programmes at level 7, which offer advanced training in the methods and application of psychological science, linked to advanced treatment of the psychological theories and methods in their chosen area of specialisation. Students on the MSc CP gain training in foundational methods for psychological research, forming the basis for a professional career as a clinical psychologist in their role as scientist practitioner. Students also practice core clinical skills and develop competencies that will prepare them for demanding clinical careers, and a highly competitive job market. Clinical Psychology Programme lead Dr Alyson Norman I have been a Lecturer in Psychology at University of Plymouth, School of Psychology since 2011. I run the MPsych and MSc Clinical Psychology programmes as well as acting as module lead for some of the clinical modules. I also work privately as a psychotherapist. My research interests include working with people with long term conditions, particularly those with appearance-altering conditions and brain injuries. I have experience of working with clients and family members of those with acquired brain injuries, both in research and in clinical practice. I am also a trustee for Headway Somerset. Course aims Advanced, training in theoretical and empirical advances in clinical psychology. Through the “current issues” and “foundations of clinical psychology” modules students will develop awareness and understanding of new research questions, debates and findings in their chosen field. Elective modules will enable students to extend this knowledge, tailoring their learning according to their specific interests. These modules are cross-cutting in nature, designed to integrate multiple research perspectives and prove relevant in different combinations for a variety of students. For example, modules such as The Brain and its Disorders enable students to explore in detail current knowledge of specific conditions, providing a secure grounding in the neuroscience of clinical approaches to schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and dementia. A thorough, experientially-based training in psychological research methods. Through core modules in advanced research methods students on all programmes will gain a secure understanding of the theory, application and limitations of quantitative statistical methods for experimental and observational data. Enhanced emphasis will be placed on fluency in data manipulation and visualisation, and in developing insight and understanding for the ways in which assumptions and theory form the basis on which statistics can be used for scientific inference.

Students’ achievements on each module will be assessed entirely through coursework, which will provide a stimulus and opportunity for them to critically evaluate the material covered, to apply it to new problems, and to develop new ideas for future research. Professionalism and professional identity For all programmes, we shall organise the academic year such that students are encouraged to think of psychological research and practice as an iterative, cyclical process involving: enquiry, design, technique, communication, practice, and reflection. Students will be encouraged to reflect on their learning regularly throughout the year, and tutorial activities will ensure this is integrated within their own research practice. The work undertaken in all modules aims to develop students’ critical understanding of research methodology, and apply it to the design of their own research projects. We will use innovative and engaging techniques to provide practical training in key clinical skills and competencies. In addition to gaining foundational knowledge of the relevant clinical guidelines and regulations, students will learn within an environment which fosters the development of key attributes of clinicians. Students will be expected to demonstrate the principles of values based practice and to be governed by professional and regulatory codes of conduct and ethics. Reflective practice will be fostered through opportunities to engage in personal and professional development. Students will work in an environment alongside other clinicians and clinical traineers, and be exposed to a wide range of clinical professionals, along with the DClinPsy trainees, who will provide a model for the attributes and qualities required of learners. Through the school’s position in the faculty of health and humans sciences, students on the CP awards are encouraged to access a wide range of events which extend their learning, including research seminars in the health professions, Schwartz rounds, and other CPD-type events as appropriate to the students’ stage and interests. Through tutorials and reflective practice students will be encouraged to engage with personal and professional development so as to develop an identity as a professional clinical worker. This intensive approach to developing, reflecting on and documenting clinical competencies provides may advantages: students can engage with important clinical skills in a safe environment, with structured and intensive feedback on their performance, and without the complexities and limitations of trying to develop these clinical skills in the workplace, alongside the inevitable competing administrative and financial considerations. Our structured PT routes provide students wishing to gain clinical experience (e.g. to support a future DClinPsy application) at the same time as they study — providing flexibility and choice to students. Disclosure and Barring Service Checks The school routinely applies for a DBS check for all CP students, but for more information on this please contact the senior administrator or faculty admin team. Research project The project counts for 40 credits out of a total of 180 for the MSc CP as a whole, or 40 out of 120 credits for the MPsych CP, and is thus a very substantial piece of work. The ability of students to conduct and report a major piece of research work is of central importance. Students should be aware that the quality of the project work will be of considerable interest to potential employers, PhD supervisors etc., with whom they may wish to work on completion of this degree. Project work has a large bearing on the reference given and potential employers may ask to see a copy of the project report. Approval of project topics and allocation of supervisors will be the responsibility of the Programme directors. In order to maximise the range of possible research topics, supervision may be arranged with any full-time member of staff of the School, not just those teaching on the programme.

Where ethical approval is not required for a particular project, students must arrange for their supervisor to email the programme lead explaining why this is the case (e.g. project is a meta-analysis) to obtain a waiver. Failing to obtain ethical clearance or a waiver will cause you to fail the module. NHS ethics Students will be conducting service evaluation projects OR empirical rojects with non-clinical samples so NHS ethical clearance will not be required. Work with children or vulnerable adults Research with children or vulnerable adults recruited through specific institutions (e.g., Schools) will need, in addition to the ethical clearance from the School, the approval of the authorities in charge of the institution. Supervision Students are expected to make to regular contact with their assigned supervisor and may be penalised if they run work which has not been approved. Supervisory contact is required for the following purposes: Advising on the literature review - although responsibility for detailed searches lies with the student Advising on and approving the design of the empirical work Advising on and approving the method of analysis to be used Advising on the interpretation of findings and the plan for the final report. The supervisor must not be asked to comment on drafts of the report itself which they will be responsible for marking together with a second independent marker. See also ‘conduct of the student’ below. Supervision out of term time Staff are not guaranteed to be on campus after the end of year period on the university calendar and the School cannot guarantee availability of supervision after this date (during the summer vacation). For this reason it is effectively a requirement that the empirical phase of the project work be completed by this date. It is strongly recommended also that students produce and agree with their supervisors a plan for the final report by the same date.

Any student who succeeds in publishing a project, even if some time after leaving Plymouth, is requested to inform the Psychology modular masters co-ordinator and send a copy of the paper. Writing up your project I have already made this paper too long, for which I must crave pardon, not having now time to make it shorter. Benjamin Franklin, 1750 The Master’s project is a substantial piece of work, and should be reflected in the care and attention given to the reporting of your results. However, the length of research reports is not a reliable indicator of the effort required to produce it, nor of it’s quality. To communicate your findings, we recommend that you identify a suitable high-impact psychological journal and organise your manuscript according to their authors instructions. Examples of suitable journals might include Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, or Qualitative Psychology. This will almost always produce a manuscript which has the follwing sections: Abstract Introduction Methods Results Discussion Most journals will accept manuscripts in the region of 4,500 to 6,500 words with a maximum of around 5 tables and 5 figures, and with around 250 words allowed for the abstract. The upper limit for masters dissertations is 10,000 words, excluding tables and references. However we suggest that you aim to keep your report closer to the limits imposed by the major journals, unless there are specific reasons why a longer report is desireable, and you have agreed this with your supervisor. Where a project is overly long, or lacks precision in the writing, then this will be marked down accordingly. To be clear: there is an upper limit of 10,000 words that will only be appropriate in a few cases. Almost all reports will be between 4,500 and 6,500 words, varying with the nature of the project. If in doubt, check with your supervisor. Use of appendices Appendices should not become a dumping ground, and should only include information necessary for the scientific understanding of your work. Examples of things which should not be included in an appendix: Illustration of the primary task used (e.g., screen capture or diagram). This should be a figure in the main report, or you should simply cite the original paper describing the task. Where a task has many variants which might interest a reader but which aren’t central to communicating the findings, however, they might be included in an appendix. A copy of the participant consent form with signatures from all participants. Brief and debrief SPSS printouts. All relevant statistical results must be reported in the Results section, in the format prescribed by the American Psychological Association in their Publication Manual. Questionnaires. If using your own questionnaire or a questionnaire that is not protected by copyright, report it in a Table. If using a questionnaire protected by copyright, or a measure which is widely used and described in a another publication, you must make sure that your method section gives a good description of what the questionnaire assessed and how it was structured but you should not report the items. You must also make sure that you cite the source of the questionnaire. Typography and layout There is no page limit for the project, but please: Include a standard cover sheet. Use a 12 point font Use double line spacing (tables may be left singlespaced) Leave at least 4cm in the right hand margin You should include a title page with the following information: Title of the study The text “Thesis submitted to the University of Plymouth for the [MSc/MPsych in ___] by [your name]”, and the year at the bottom of the page. Next should be a page on which you copy the following text: “The work reported in this thesis received ethical approval from the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences and complies with the guidelines set by the British Psychological Society.” On this page you can also include acknowledgements (thank people who helped you get through your project and add any comment you see fit). On the next page would be your actual report. References should start on a page of their own. Figures and tables should be placed at relevant locations within the text and clearly labelled and numbered. Don’t copy them all to the end of the manuscript. Contribution of the student Second markers will be given information about the conduct and contribution of students. This should not be used for the routine adjustment of marks ( e.g. higher marks for larger student contributions) but instead should be used to disambiguate work near grade boundaries, or to resolve discrepancies between markers. Expectations of AP projects The design and analysis of AP student projects should reflect the extended coverage given to methods in the course. Projects need not demonstrate competence in every technique covered but – where relevant – reports should demonstrate students’ awareness of key concepts and handle data accordingly. Key concepts include: Statistical power Statistical inference and causation Pitfalls of null hypothesis significance testing Handling repeated measures data Missing data Issues in qualitative data analysis Project marking All projects are double-marked by supervisors and another academic within the school. Where a fail grade is given by one or both markers, then a third marker will also assess the work. The normal guidelines for marking within the school apply. Indicative grades A mark of 50-59% or more indicates competent work of masters standard; a mark of 60-69% indicates work at the merit level and a mark of 70% or more indicates work at distinction level. For all masters courses, the pass mark is 50%. Below are the characteristics of report which markers will use to determine your grade: Introduction : The introduction should show: - Range, relevance and quality of understanding shown in the student’s reading of literature. - Organisation and quality of the prose. You should aim to be concise and precise throughout the report. - Clarity of the exposition of the rationale for the study, and the linkage with the literature review. NOTE: Because the project report should be modelled on the form of a journal article, introductions should be focused on specific aims and not contain detailed reviews of literature not directly relevant to the study. Method : The methods section should demonstrate - Quality of the design and relevance to the objectives of the study. - Level of ambition in terms of both the scale of the study and the relative complexity of the methodology employed. - Competence and thoroughness in the conduct of the study. - Presentation of the method section in terms of clarity, organisation, thoroughness and concision. You should present all details necessary to replicate the study, but not more. Results : Results sections should evidence - Quality, competence, appropriateness, and thoroughness of the analysis of data. - Organisation and clarity of the presentation of results. - Appropriateness and quality of presentation of graphs, figures and tables. Discussion : A discussion should show: - Clear exposition of the findings. - Understanding and interpretation of the findings. - Critical appraisal of the study and its methodology. - Discussion of broader theoretical implications in the context established by the introduction. - Quality of presentation of arguments; organisation, style and clarity. - Implications for clinical practice or service delivery. Data sharing and research transparency All of the data you collect should be submitted alongside your project report, unless specifically agreed with your supervisors and the programme lead in advance (for example, because of practical or ethical constraints). These data should be documented, such that other researchers could replicate your analysis if required. More guidance will be given throughout the project planning and project modules, but as a minimum we would expect CP students to submit: Raw datafiles in csv or other appropriate format Code to combine/process data into an ‘analysable data file’ - normally a csv The analysable file itself In addition, it is increasingly becoming the norm to submit code for the analyses you report alongside your data, for example using R or RMarkdown files. Qualitative projects For projects employing qualitative or interpretative methods, special ethical conditions may apply — for example to audio or transcript data. This may prevent putting all data in the public domain. However you should aim to: Secure consent from participants to share anonymised transcript data. Share anonymised transcripts, as far as this is ethical/practical. Share details of intermediate analyses, e.g. using software such as NVivo. See\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping↩ "],
