### Degree classifications {#mpsych-classification}

Overall degree classifications, which are shown on your final degree transcript,
are awarded based on the average mark across all modules, as follows:

-   First (>=70%, grades A- to A+)
-   2:1 (60-69%, grades B- to B+)
-   2:2 (50%-59%, grades C- to C+)
-   Fail (< 50%, grades D+ and below)

### Progression and graduation

All MPsych students in their final year (stage 5) must complete 120 credits to
graduate with an MPsych award.

For this final year of the degree, the university' standard postgraduate
regulations in relation to assessment and progression apply.

Students on the MPsych programmes who fail to complete 120 credits in their
final year will be awarded a BSc degree, based on their work in stage 1-4. See
the programme specification for more details, or speak to the [faculty
administrator](#facultyadmin.
