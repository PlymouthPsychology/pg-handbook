### Welcome  
 
![](../static/s200_timhollins.jpg){.thumbnail}

Welcome to MSc in psychological research with Plymouth University. For you, this year is the start of a fascinating intellectual journey to the heart of Psychology. 
 
Whether you are returning after several years of work, joining us from another institution, or continuing your undergraduate study at Plymouth, psychology is an exciting and dynamic subject. It has grown enormously in scope and influence within the last decade or so. The range of expertise of our staff reflects this dynamism and diversity. We are sure you will enjoy the opportunities that studying within this environment will bring. 
 
Talking of opportunities: the work you cover this year will form an essential foundation for postgraduate study of psychology, or advanced psychological practice. Graduates of the course have succeeded in a wide range of academic, and professional roles, and the course is designed to help you maximise your ability to exploit psychological knowledge to succeed in the workplace.

It is important that you remain focused on your work, and do well in your assessments. Remember, if you need advice or help with an area of work or with something outside the course that affects your work, you have a personal tutor who is a member of staff in the School, and you can approach him or her when you need to. Your fellow students are another important source of help and advice: our community of masters students is tight knit and supportive, so make the most of your peers.

The information in this handbook complements the University’s online student handbook. It is helpful if you familiarise yourself with the contents of both before teaching starts, and you will need to refer to it throughout the year. If you have previously studied at Plymouth, you will find somethings familiar, but many aspect of postgraduate life will still be new.

If you have a question about this year, then you should be able to find an answer in the handbook. If you cannot find the answer to your question here, then the best place to ask initially is the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Student Reception (on the fourth floor of the Rolle building). The staff there will either be able to answer your question or direct you to someone who can. Alternatively, you can ask your programme lead. 
 
The staff in the School of Psychology welcome you as a fellow member of the School and of the University, and look forward to working with you on the challenge and excitement of studying psychology. 
 
Good luck, and enjoy your year. 
 
 
Professor Tim Hollins 
Head of School

### Official module and programme documentation {-}

The University keeps an official, publicly available record of all
current modules and programmes which it has validated. The record of a
module is called a Definitive Module Record (DMR) and for a whole
programme, it is called a programme specification. The DMR provides
information on the aims, intended learning outcomes, indicative syllabus
content of the module and other relevant matters. The programme
specification provides information on the rationale, aims and intended
learning outcomes of the programme as well as information on the way the
programme is organised. You can find these documents by typing the
module code or the phrase ‘Psychology Programme Specification’ into the
