# The Programme

TODO CHANGE ME

The aim of the MSc in XXX is to provide a broad training in research methods used by psychologists, alongside specialist content in your research area.

Students gain in-depth and highly specialised expertise with cutting edge theory and methods in their area of interest, using elective modules to tailor their path through the programme to their chosen specialty, undertaking novel research, and extending the boundaries of current knowledge under the guidance of experts.

_A thorough, experientially-based training in psychological research methods._ Through core modules in advanced research methods students on all programmes will gain a secure understanding of the theory, application and limitations of quantitative statistical methods for experimental and observational data. Enhanced emphasis will be placed on fluency in data manipulation and visualisation, and in developing insight and understanding for the ways in which assumptions and theory form the basis on which statistics can be used for scientific inference.

_Specialist techniques_ (e.g. statistical inference, cognitive behavioural therapy) will be offered as options, to ensure students can extend this conceptual understanding with practical experience applying specific techniques required in particular research domains.

_Advanced training in theoretical and empirical advances in cognitive and brain science, behaviour change, or clinical psychology_. Through the “current issues” and “foundations of clinical psychology” modules students will develop awareness and understanding of new research questions, debates and findings in their chosen field. Elective modules will enable students to extend this knowledge, tailoring their learning according to their specific interests. These modules are cross-cutting in nature, designed to integrate multiple research perspectives and prove relevant in different combinations for a variety of students. For example, modules such as The Brain and its Disorders enable students to explore in detail current knowledge of specific conditions, providing a secure grounding in the neuroscience of clinical approaches to schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and dementia.

_Deep and thorough conceptual understanding of chosen areas of study_. All aspects of the programme aims towards deepening conceptual understanding of the theoretical, empirical, and methodological advances in their field. Students’ achievements on each module are assessed entirely through coursework, providing a stimulus and opportunity to critically evaluate the material covered, to apply it to new problems, and to develop new ideas for future research.

_Professionalism and professional identity_. We organise the academic year such that students are encouraged to think of psychological research and practice as an iterative, cyclical process involving: enquiry, design, technique, communication, practice, and reflection. You will be encouraged to reflect on your learning regularly throughout the year, and project supervision tutorial activities will ensure this is integrated within your own research practice.

## Our commitment {#student-charter}

The Student Charter is an agreement between the University, the Students’ Union, and the student body. It sets out the expectations that you should have of the University, and also the expectations we have of you. For instance, you can expect that we will provide you with a challenging and invigorating curriculum, and we expect you to take an active role in your learning.
We hope the charter provides a useful framework for both staff and students.

## Have your say {#haveyoursay}

\index{Student voice}

Your experiences matter to us – much of what we do is aimed at helping you learn, so we need to know whether we are doing the right things. The School of Psychology is a learning community, and students should consider themselves active participants.

### If something is wrong, _please let us know_.

```{r child="common/we-need-your-input.Rmd"}

```

> If you have a question now, take a look at our [guide to getting questions answered](#i-have-a-question).

### Informal feedback

You can meet with academic staff at any time during the year. All staff have two office hours which they should make known during lectures, and during these periods you can drop in with questions without an appointment. Staff are also happy to meet students by appointment (email them) at any time during the term.

As an aside, we find that students who meet regularly with academic staff during the year are often those who perform well on the degree. Don't hide away if you have questions or are unclear on material from lectures --- asking questions is the best way to learn.

### Course Reps and The Student Advocate

Student reps are psychology students who have either volunteered or been elected to represent all students on their programme. Reps have an important role in communicating your views to the School. They are supported by a senior member of staff - the Student Advocate - who helps them turn your suggestions about the course and the School into actions. Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email.^[Contact details for the student reps will be posted on the programme DLE site once they are appointed, after 30th September.]

Dr Patric Bach is the schools' Student Advocate this year. His role is to mentor the student reps and help them maintain excellent communication between you and the School. Patric works with reps across all stages and all programmes in Psychology, including the MPsych Advanced Psychology, BSc (Hons) Psychology and joint honours programmes, and our postgraduate Masters and DClinPsy programmes.

Reps for the MSc courses and the Student Advocate attend meetings of the Postgraduate Programme Committee twice a term to present the issues relevant to their course, including teaching and assessment arrangements, the coverage of the course, and issues with the wider university. Their role is to make the voice of Psychology students heard at School level and to communicate the position of the School of Psychology back to students.

### Formal feedback and evaluation of the programmes

At various points whilst studying on your programme, you will be asked to provide formal structured feedback about the modules you are studying and the programme as a whole. This feedback takes two forms. First, the School of Psychology asks you to complete a module evaluation in each semester. These evaluations are online and are completed by accessing a special module evaluation web page. This web page is accessible via the DLE. You will be given instructions on how to access the page at the time when module evaluations are required.

Second, the University asks MSc students to complete an annual University-wide survey called the PTES. This allows the University to track the views of students about their course and the University facilities.

When you are asked to complete one of these evaluations, please take the time to do so. The information which can be obtained from them is vitally important in monitoring the quality of courses, and provides information which can help in the planning of future courses and facilities.

All responses to these evaluation instruments are confidential or anonymous. You will never be identified as an individual. There will be no comeback on you in any form for any views which you express in these surveys.

### Feedback box

We also have an online feedback box, which you can use to tell us about the course. It is completely anonymous. Your identity is not recorded unless you write your name or email address in the box, so you might prefer this to email if you want to express your views without us knowing who you are. The feedback box is here:

-   <https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/communitybox/>

### The MSc Programme Committee

The Programme Committee is a formal venue for the management of the programme, and the exchange of views between staff and student. Elected student representatives are invited, and meetings are normally held at least twice a year. We earnestly hope that students will feel able to raise problems informally (and before these meetings) so they may be dealt with as soon as possible. ^[See the programme DLE site for more information about the programme committee.]

## Taught modules

Each module is described on it's own DLE page, and each will have a module
outline which summarises the aims, the teaching schedule, key
readings or references, and the assessment requirements for the module.
PRM students must choose three out of the seven non-core modules.

## Module choices {#module-choices}

\index{Choice (modules)}
\index{Module choice}

Prior to induction week the faculty administrator will email students with a list of options, from which they can select. This will also be provided _during_ induction week for any students applying late.

During induction week we run a number of sessions providing more information about modules, and all students need to confirm their semester-1 options within 1 week.

Confirming module choices is important because it allows us to enrol you on modules on the university's digital learning environment, which means you will get access to teaching materials and will receive email and other communications from the module leader.

### Changing options or modules {#module-changes}

Requests for changes to modules/options will be considered and accommodated where possible. Please make applications via email to the faculty administrator within the first two teaching weeks of each term.

Where optional modules do not overlap in the timetable students _are_ permitted to sit-in on additional classes, with the agreement of the module or programme lead.

However you should be clear that you can only be enrolled on 180 credits in total, and will be required to submit CW for those modules you are enrolled on. Only modules for which you are enrolled will count towards your degree classification.

Some modules contain multiple sub-options (e.g. PSY561/PSY562). Provided that space allows, and with the agreement of the option leader, it is permitted for students to attend more than one session in the first week and request to change options thereafter (although we cannot guarantee that all requests can be accommodated).

### Module choices for PT students.

For part-time students, consideration should be given to overall workload, and the balance of options across both years.

This often means taking more credits in year 2 than 1, because PT students will be allocated a project supervisor and may complete much of the work required for the project, even though they are not officially enrolled on the project module PSY571.

Typically, we recommend students complete PSY556, PSY561 and PSY571 in their first year, with 30 or 40 additional credits selected from taught options.

PT students should confirm which modules they wish to take within 1 week of the start of term.

## Attendance {#attendance}

\index{Attendance}

Most students study the PRM as a full time course, and it places considerable demands on your time and energies. Nonetheless, _we expect all students to attend all scheduled classes, and some modules require attendance as part of their assesment criteria._

We know from experience (and results data) that students who don't attend perform poorly. We recommend that full time students undertake no more than 8 hours part time work per week while teaching is taking place (between September and April) and it is essential that part time work does not interfere with your attendance at lectures.

If there are unavoidable circumstances which mean that you cannot attend the University you should register these as 'extenuating circumstances'. Please see the section on [extenuating circumstances](#excircs) below (page \pageref{excircs}). You should also discuss these circumstances with the programme coordinator.

### Attendance monitoring

\index{Attendance monitoring}

The University is currently initiating a policy of monitoring attendance on all taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Details of this will be finalised during the year, but it is possible that attendance will be monitored in selected lectures and workshops throughout the year

The University also has specific policies on attendance and engagement for overseas students, and those with Tier 4 visa requirements.^[More information can be found at <https://goo.gl/779Ywd>.]

### Cancelled classes

\index{Cancelled classes}

[![](../static/scheduling_conflict_2x.png){.xkcd}](../static/scheduling_conflict_2x.png)

If a class has to be cancelled, we contact you as early as possible, usually via email. Sometimes lecturers become unavailable (e.g. sudden illness) without much notice. When this happens, please help us by using your own contact networks to share information with other students. We will often provide a replacement class for any that is cancelled, or rearrange teaching so that all essential material is covered.

## Self-study

In addition to your timetabled classes, you will need to spend a _significant amount of time reading, doing exercises, \index{Self study} completing coursework assignments and revising for tests or examinations_. The University expects a student to spend 100 hours undertaking a 10-credit module. Given that you will be studying 180 credits each year, this equates to 1800 hours per year – a substantial proportion of your time. You should bear this is mind if you are considering part-time work, and ensure this does not impact on your ability to study.

## Withdrawal/Suspension from a Programme

\index{Withdrawing}
\index{Suspending}

There may be occasions when you decide to withdraw or interrupt your studies for certain reasons, you need to consult your programme lead and seek advice if you have a particular problem.

If you decide to withdraw or interrupt you must inform the programme coordinator and the faculty secretary as soon as possible.

Students should be aware that there are deadlines for the full or partial refund of tuition fees. Further information is available here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/regulations/withdrawing-from-or-suspending-study
