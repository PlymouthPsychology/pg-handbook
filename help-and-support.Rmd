## PsySoc

A message from the Chair:

> “PsySoc was founded at the end of 2006 by students who felt that there was a real gap for a society where Psychology students from all years could meet each other, socialise and learn from each other’s experiences. It was in this mind that we decided that PsySoc would provide traditional social get-togethers, but also some academic activities such as guest lecturers, book sales, and support. PsySoc aims to provide an outlet for all students to get together and enjoy each other's company, be it in an academic or social setting, and our committee works hard to make sure that this happens. We do have a FaceBook site, and we will be making ourselves known throughout the year, so there is plenty of opportunity to join us in whatever capacity you feel is right for you, from helping out other students, attending guest lectures or just joining us on a social. However much you want to join in, PsySoc provides the opportunity to meet other psychology students from all years, and from all backgrounds.”
