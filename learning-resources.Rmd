## The Digital Learning Environment

\index{DLE}
\index{Moodle}

You will hear much talk of 'the DLE', which stands for _Digital Learning Environment_. It also sometimes gets called 'moodle', which is the name of the software used by the system.

The DLE is central to your learning at Plymouth, and you need to familiarise yourself with it as soon as possible.

Put simply, the DLE is a website run by the university to provide students with a central point for all course information, and for you to [submit work](#submitting-coursework) and recieve feedback.

You can login to the DLE at: <http://dle.plymouth.ac.uk>.

Please make sure you check the following on the DLE as soon as possible:

-   Your _programme site_
-   The site for each of your semester 1 modules
-   Your university email^[You should check your university email at least once per day to avoid missing important communications from the school. See the [expectations around email](#email) section.].

On each module site you should^[If any of these are missing or not obvious, please let the module leader or programme coordinator know] see:

-   A module outline
-   Key readings for the course
