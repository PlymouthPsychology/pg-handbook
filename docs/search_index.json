["index.html", "MSc Psychological Research Methods", " MSc Psychological Research Methods Welcome Welcome to MSc in psychological research with Plymouth University. For you, this year is the start of a fascinating intellectual journey to the heart of Psychology. Whether you are returning after several years of work, joining us from another institution, or continuing your undergraduate study at Plymouth, psychology is an exciting and dynamic subject. It has grown enormously in scope and influence within the last decade or so. The range of expertise of our staff reflects this dynamism and diversity. We are sure you will enjoy the opportunities that studying within this environment will bring. Talking of opportunities: the work you cover this year will form an essential foundation for postgraduate study of psychology, or advanced psychological practice. Graduates of the course have succeeded in a wide range of academic, and professional roles, and the course is designed to help you maximise your ability to exploit psychological knowledge to succeed in the workplace. It is important that you remain focused on your work, and do well in your assessments. Remember, if you need advice or help with an area of work or with something outside the course that affects your work, you have a personal tutor who is a member of staff in the School, and you can approach him or her when you need to. Your fellow students are another important source of help and advice: our community of masters students is tight knit and supportive, so make the most of your peers. The information in this handbook complements the University’s online student handbook. It is helpful if you familiarise yourself with the contents of both before teaching starts, and you will need to refer to it throughout the year. If you have previously studied at Plymouth, you will find somethings familiar, but many aspect of postgraduate life will still be new. If you have a question about this year, then you should be able to find an answer in the handbook. If you cannot find the answer to your question here, then the best place to ask initially is the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, Student Reception (on the fourth floor of the Rolle building). The staff there will either be able to answer your question or direct you to someone who can. Alternatively, you can ask your programme lead. The staff in the School of Psychology welcome you as a fellow member of the School and of the University, and look forward to working with you on the challenge and excitement of studying psychology. Good luck, and enjoy your year. Professor Tim Hollins Head of School Accessibility This publication is also available in electronic format the university digital learning environment (DLE). All publications provided by the School of Psychology are similarly available. Direct any queries or concerns relating to accessibility to your Programme Coordinator, or the Faculty of Health and Human Sciences Student Reception on the fourth floor of the Rolle Building, telephone number 01752 585332 (rollestudentreception@plymouth.ac.uk). Official module and programme documentation The University keeps an official, publicly available record of all current modules and programmes which it has validated. The record of a module is called a Definitive Module Record (DMR) and for a whole programme, it is called a programme specification. The DMR provides information on the aims, intended learning outcomes, indicative syllabus content of the module and other relevant matters. The programme specification provides information on the rationale, aims and intended learning outcomes of the programme as well as information on the way the programme is organised. You can find these documents by typing the module code or the phrase ‘Psychology Programme Specification’ into the search tab at the top of your portal start page. "],
["the-programme.html", "The Programme", " The Programme The aim of the MSc in Psychological Research Methods (known as the PRM) is to provide a broad training in research methods used by psychologists, alongside specialist content in your research area. Students gain in-depth and highly specialised expertise with cutting edge theory and methods in their area of interest, using elective modules to tailor their path through the programme to their chosen specialty, undertaking novel research, and extending the boundaries of current knowledge under the guidance of experts. A thorough, experientially-based training in psychological research methods. Through core modules in advanced research methods students on all programmes will gain a secure understanding of the theory, application and limitations of quantitative statistical methods for experimental and observational data. Enhanced emphasis will be placed on fluency in data manipulation and visualisation, and in developing insight and understanding for the ways in which assumptions and theory form the basis on which statistics can be used for scientific inference. Specialist techniques (e.g. statistical inference, cognitive behavioural therapy) will be offered as options, to ensure students can extend this conceptual understanding with practical experience applying specific techniques required in particular research domains. Advanced training in theoretical and empirical advances in cognitive and brain science, behaviour change, or clinical psychology. Through the “current issues” and “foundations of clinical psychology” modules students will develop awareness and understanding of new research questions, debates and findings in their chosen field. Elective modules will enable students to extend this knowledge, tailoring their learning according to their specific interests. These modules are cross-cutting in nature, designed to integrate multiple research perspectives and prove relevant in different combinations for a variety of students. For example, modules such as The Brain and its Disorders enable students to explore in detail current knowledge of specific conditions, providing a secure grounding in the neuroscience of clinical approaches to schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease and dementia. Deep and thorough conceptual understanding of chosen areas of study. All aspects of the programme aims towards deepening conceptual understanding of the theoretical, empirical, and methodological advances in their field. Students’ achievements on each module are assessed entirely through coursework, providing a stimulus and opportunity to critically evaluate the material covered, to apply it to new problems, and to develop new ideas for future research. Professionalism and professional identity. We organise the academic year such that students are encouraged to think of psychological research and practice as an iterative, cyclical process involving: enquiry, design, technique, communication, practice, and reflection. You will be encouraged to reflect on your learning regularly throughout the year, and project supervision tutorial activities will ensure this is integrated within your own research practice. "],
["student-charter.html", "Our commitment", " Our commitment The Student Charter is an agreement between the University, the Students’ Union, and the student body. It sets out the expectations that you should have of the University, and also the expectations we have of you. For instance, you can expect that we will provide you with a challenging and invigorating curriculum, and we expect you to take an active role in your learning. We hope the charter provides a useful framework for both staff and students. You can find it here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/student-charter "],
["haveyoursay.html", "Have your say", " Have your say Your experiences matter to us – much of what we do is aimed at helping you learn, so we need to know whether we are doing the right things. The School of Psychology is a learning community, and students should consider themselves active participants. If something is wrong, please let us know. When things go wrong or could be made even better than they are now, it is quite likely that you will spot it before we do. So, it is important that you let us know when there are problems. These problems vary in how easily they can be addressed. Some can be dealt with straight away once they are brought to the attention of the right person. Other problems require more detailed consideration and widespread discussion, so they inevitably take longer to fix. Sometimes they are large enough to warrant a major course overhaul and may not be fixed in time to benefit you. However, such changes to the course will benefit those who follow on in the future. Sadly, there are some problems that are a consequence of resource limitations or external constraints, and we may not be able to do much about them, but at least we will be able to let you know the reasons why those problems exist. In any event, it is important that you let us know what you think, and you can be sure that your views will be an important part of any decision making process. If you have a question now, take a look at our guide to getting questions answered. Informal feedback You can meet with academic staff at any time during the year. All staff have two office hours which they should make known during lectures, and during these periods you can drop in with questions without an appointment. Staff are also happy to meet students by appointment (email them) at any time during the term. As an aside, we find that students who meet regularly with academic staff during the year are often those who perform well on the degree. Don’t hide away if you have questions or are unclear on material from lectures — asking questions is the best way to learn. Course Reps and The Student Advocate Student reps are psychology students who have either volunteered or been elected to represent all students on their programme. Reps have an important role in communicating your views to the School. They are supported by a senior member of staff - the Student Advocate - who helps them turn your suggestions about the course and the School into actions. Student reps are happy to be approached with questions or ideas before or after classes. They can also be contacted by email.1 Dr Patric Bach is the schools’ Student Advocate this year. His role is to mentor the student reps and help them maintain excellent communication between you and the School. Patric works with reps across all stages and all programmes in Psychology, including the MPsych Advanced Psychology, BSc (Hons) Psychology and joint honours programmes, and our postgraduate Masters and DClinPsy programmes. Reps for the MSc courses and the Student Advocate attend meetings of the Postgraduate Programme Committee twice a term to present the issues relevant to their course, including teaching and assessment arrangements, the coverage of the course, and issues with the wider university. Their role is to make the voice of Psychology students heard at School level and to communicate the position of the School of Psychology back to students. Formal feedback and evaluation of the programmes At various points whilst studying on your programme, you will be asked to provide formal structured feedback about the modules you are studying and the programme as a whole. This feedback takes two forms. First, the School of Psychology asks you to complete a module evaluation in each semester. These evaluations are online and are completed by accessing a special module evaluation web page. This web page is accessible via the DLE. You will be given instructions on how to access the page at the time when module evaluations are required. Second, the University asks MSc students to complete an annual University-wide survey called the PTES. This allows the University to track the views of students about their course and the University facilities. When you are asked to complete one of these evaluations, please take the time to do so. The information which can be obtained from them is vitally important in monitoring the quality of courses, and provides information which can help in the planning of future courses and facilities. All responses to these evaluation instruments are confidential or anonymous. You will never be identified as an individual. There will be no comeback on you in any form for any views which you express in these surveys. Feedback box We also have an online feedback box, which you can use to tell us about the course. It is completely anonymous. Your identity is not recorded unless you write your name or email address in the box, so you might prefer this to email if you want to express your views without us knowing who you are. The feedback box is here: https://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/communitybox/ The MSc Programme Committee The Programme Committee is a formal venue for the management of the programme, and the exchange of views between staff and student. Elected student representatives are invited, and meetings are normally held at least twice a year. We earnestly hope that students will feel able to raise problems informally (and before these meetings) so they may be dealt with as soon as possible. 2 Contact details for the student reps will be posted on the programme DLE site once they are appointed, after 30th September.↩ See the programme DLE site for more information about the programme committee.↩ "],
["taught-modules.html", "Taught modules", " Taught modules Each module is described on it’s own DLE page, and each will have a module outline which summarises the aims, the teaching schedule, key readings or references, and the assessment requirements for the module. PRM students must choose three out of the seven non-core modules. TODO "],
["module-choices.html", "Module choices", " Module choices Prior to induction week the faculty administrator will email students with a list of options, from which they can select. This will also be provided during induction week for any students applying late. During induction week we run a number of sessions providing more information about modules, and all students need to confirm their semester-1 options within 1 week. Confirming module choices is important because it allows us to enrol you on modules on the university’s digital learning environment, which means you will get access to teaching materials and will receive email and other communications from the module leader. Changing options or modules Requests for changes to modules/options will be considered and accommodated where possible. Please make applications via email to the faculty administrator within the first two teaching weeks of each term. Where optional modules do not overlap in the timetable students are permitted to sit-in on additional classes, with the agreement of the module or programme lead. However you should be clear that you can only be enrolled on 180 credits in total, and will be required to submit CW for those modules you are enrolled on. Only modules for which you are enrolled will count towards your degree classification. Some modules contain multiple sub-options (e.g. PSY561/PSY562). Provided that space allows, and with the agreement of the option leader, it is permitted for students to attend more than one session in the first week and request to change options thereafter (although we cannot guarantee that all requests can be accommodated). Module choices for PT students. For part-time students, consideration should be given to overall workload, and the balance of options across both years. This often means taking more credits in year 2 than 1, because PT students will be allocated a project supervisor and may complete much of the work required for the project, even though they are not officially enrolled on the project module PSY571. Typically, we recommend students complete PSY556, PSY561 and PSY571 in their first year, with 30 or 40 additional credits selected from taught options. PT students should confirm which modules they wish to take within 1 week of the start of term. "],
["attendance.html", "Attendance", " Attendance Most students study the PRM as a full time course, and it places considerable demands on your time and energies. Nonetheless, we expect all students to attend all scheduled classes, and some modules require attendance as part of their assesment criteria. We know from experience (and results data) that students who don’t attend perform poorly. We recommend that full time students undertake no more than 8 hours part time work per week while teaching is taking place (between September and April) and it is essential that part time work does not interfere with your attendance at lectures. If there are unavoidable circumstances which mean that you cannot attend the University you should register these as ‘extenuating circumstances’. Please see the section on extenuating circumstances below (page ). You should also discuss these circumstances with the programme coordinator. Attendance monitoring The University is currently initiating a policy of monitoring attendance on all taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Details of this will be finalised during the year, but it is possible that attendance will be monitored in selected lectures and workshops throughout the year The University also has specific policies on attendance and engagement for overseas students, and those with Tier 4 visa requirements.3 Cancelled classes If a class has to be cancelled, we contact you as early as possible, usually via email. Sometimes lecturers become unavailable (e.g. sudden illness) without much notice. When this happens, please help us by using your own contact networks to share information with other students. We will often provide a replacement class for any that is cancelled, or rearrange teaching so that all essential material is covered. More information can be found at https://goo.gl/779Ywd.↩ "],
["self-study.html", "Self-study", " Self-study In addition to your timetabled classes, you will need to spend a significant amount of time reading, doing exercises, completing coursework assignments and revising for tests or examinations. The University expects a student to spend 100 hours undertaking a 10-credit module. Given that you will be studying 180 credits each year, this equates to 1800 hours per year – a substantial proportion of your time. You should bear this is mind if you are considering part-time work, and ensure this does not impact on your ability to study. "],

The University, Faculty and School publish Safety handbooks which are available online through the portal. These provide guidance on safe working practices and specific risks which you may encounter. Fire In the event of a fire alarm sounding you must leave the building by the nearest available main exit. If your route to a main exit is obstructed then you should evacuate by way of the next available fire exit. When the alarm sounds you must stop what you are doing immediately, even if you are in the middle of an experiment you must stop. If you are a researcher running an experiment then you should make sure that your participant(s) respond to the alarm. Do not use the lifts or re-enter the building until the all clear is given by a fire marshal (wearing a yellow tabbard) General Hazards The responsible safety manager is Professor Tim Hollins, as Head of School. Safety coordination within the School is delegated to the Technical Manager, Anthony Mee. Any concerns about safety should be communicated to Anthony in the Technical Office, Room Link 109. If you become aware of any hazard or broken equipment this should be reported immediately to the Technical Office. Health If you make extensive use of computers you should familiarise yourself with advice available online regarding posture and working position. In general laptops are poorly designed for extensive periods of use and desktop screens should be adjusted to be at eye level. If you suffer from any condition requiring medication or reducing your mobility please make sure that those around are aware and know what to do in the event of an emergency. Security staff are all trained first aiders, and in the Link block Lynne James in the Technical Office is also a First Aider.

There are 3 main modes of communication used on the course: Face to face meetings during staff office hours Email Microsoft Teams (an instant messaging/discussion forum and more) Each has it’s own strengths: but we aware that all staff recieve high volumes of email and you should avoid using email, if possible. I have a question, what should I do? The following diagram describes the best way of getting a question about the course or a module answered… Face to face Our academic staff are based in Portland Square on the second floor of A block and B block. Staff typically specify two ‘office hours’ during the week when they are in their offices and available for student queries. Please use these office hours. Talking to us face-to-face is usually a friendlier and more efficient way of communicating than email, and students who come to our office hours tend to have a better experience. Many staff will be available to see you outside their office hours, but please make an appointment first via email.

These can all be accessed at: https://login.live.com Login with your university email address, and computing account password. Using email Email is the main way in which staff in the School and the University will communicate with you. Important messages about the programme, including changes to assessments, or changes in time and location of classes or exams, will be e-mailed to you. You must check your emails regularly – at least once a day during term time. What you should expect from staff: All staff aim to respond to students promptly, and always within 2 working days. However, you should not expect staff to respond outside of normal working hours (roughly 9am-6pm), and should not rely on staff responding immediately when deadlines are looming. Yammer or other forums might be a better bet at this point. Out of term time, if a staff member is unavailable please contact the module leader or the programme coordinator. The school office will also be able to put you in contact with available staff. If you change either your term time address or your normal vacation address please make sure that you inform the School. Whenever possible please supply telephone numbers with your addresses.

It was in this mind that we decided that PsySoc would provide traditional social get-togethers, but also some academic activities such as guest lecturers, book sales, and support. PsySoc aims to provide an outlet for all students to get together and enjoy each other’s company, be it in an academic or social setting, and our committee works hard to make sure that this happens. We do have a FaceBook site, and we will be making ourselves known throughout the year, so there is plenty of opportunity to join us in whatever capacity you feel is right for you, from helping out other students, attending guest lectures or just joining us on a social.

["assessment.html", "Coursework and Assessment", " Coursework and Assessment Assessment is an important component of the programme, and feedback is vital for you to progress. All assessment on the PRM is based upon coursework, and we have no formal examinations. Coursework is tailored to the needs of individual modules. Modules may have several coursework components which make up the total assessment. Assessment is a complex topic, but this section attempts to distill some of the key information which students need to understand how their work is assessed on the MSc and MPsych courses at Plymouth, including: ‘Level descriptors’: These are broad descriptions of what is expected from students on each type of course Learning outcomes and assessment criteria Marking schemes, grade boundaries Marking and moderation processes Summary All coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-, and all grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked. Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark which is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate courses is set at 50%. Overall degree classifications, which are shown on your final degree transcript, are awarded based on the average mark across all modules, as follows: Distinction/First (&gt;=70%, grades A- to A+)8 Merit/2:1 (60-69%, grades B- to B+) Pass/2:2 (50%-59%, grades C- to C+) Fail (&lt; 50%, grades D+ and below) If you ever have a question about a grade you have been awarded, in the first instance contact the module leader to discuss it, for example during their office hours.

["submitting-coursework.html", "Submitting coursework", " Submitting coursework All work must be submitted via the DLE. No submissions can be accepted on paper, or via email, unless this is required to meet specific accessibility requirements. Pre-submission checklist Before submitting work, you might like to use the following checklist. ::: {.checklist} ☐ Reviewed previous feedback ☐ Spell-checked manuscript ☐ Proofread/grammar-check complete ☐ Cover sheet attached ☐ Converted to PDF ::: Coursework cover sheet The MSc coursework cover sheet is available here: masters_coursework_template.dotx This coversheet includes a section in which you can write your reflections on your own work. You need to: Have a look at the grading criteria described here. Think about your work, and how it corresponds to those criteria. Think too about any previous feedback you have had and whether you have taken heed of it in the writing of the work you are to submit. Finally, explain to the marker which aspects of your work you particularly want to get feedback on. Are you worried about your essay structure? Are you unsure about how you have set out results? Do you think you’ve strongly addressed the question? Tell the marker, so that they can address these questions in their feedback. Feedback to expect Essays and practical reports include several types of feedback. General comments on the front of the work are designed to give a brief, and holistic, summary of the strong and weak points of your work. These general comments reflect the specific notes and highlights in the text where an example has been highlighted. Please read the general comments with the specific annotations in mind, and vice versa, so that you can identify some of the elements that have contributed to the overall assessment and grade, and use this feedback when reflecting on your performance on the next piece of work you submit. School style guide All coursework should be written using the coursework template provided above. This document has the correct margins, font, line spacing and so on pre-set. These requirements are also set out below which you should use unless the module leader instructs otherwise: Use Arial 12 point font Use double line spacing Use left alignment (not justified text) The top and bottom margins should be 2.5 cm. The left margin should be 1 cm and the right margin should be 4 cm. The extra space in the right margin is to allow for written feedback. Put your student number on each page (in the Header). Do not put your name on the pages. Make sure the piece of work is referenced according to the APA guidelines. Diagrams, figures and tables can be either computer generated or hand drawn and then scanned. Include diagrams and figures within the body of the assessment rather than on separate pages as appendices. Label each diagram, figure or table with a number and a clear and brief title. Page or word limits For some coursework, the module leader will specify a word limit. Where a page or word limit is specified, you must adhere to it and use the school specified format. Failure to do so may incur a mark penalty. For other coursework a module leader may instead stipulate a maximum number of pages using the School’s style guidelines. You must follow the presentation guidelines above in order to conform to the stipulated number of pages for the assessment. If you exceed this page length or you do not follow the style guidelines then your work will be penalised by the deduction of grades. The specified page limit excludes the reference list and the page reflecting on past feedback (see above). The deductions for exceeding the page limit will be applied as follows: Up to 1 page over the stipulated length: 1 grade reduction Up to 2 pages over the stipulated length: 2 grade reduction Up to 3 pages over the stipulated length: 3 grade reduction Up to 4 or more pages over the stipulated length: 4 grade reduction A one-grade reduction means, for example, that would receive a B- instead of a B. A four-grade reduction would mean that you receive a C- instead of a B. There will also be grade deductions if you submit work which does not conform to the style guidelines. Deductions will be made according to the extent of deviation from the style guidelines and the overall length of the submitted assessment.

Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of feedback. Coursework submission on the DLE Please note the following important points about submitting work on the DLE. When you submit work on the DLE, you may notice that you can submit multiple times. Some students find this helpful. It also allows students who are in the process of claiming extenuating circumstances (EC) to submit a draft of their work, to guard against the possibility their claim for EC is not granted. HOWEVER, this means that it is possible for you to submit work after the deadline, and you should know that if you do this without valid EC your mark will be capped at 50%. This capping occurs even if you have previously submitted a draft before the deadline, because the DLE does not record the content of this submission, and we can mark only the latest one added. Consequently, it’s extremely important for you to submit on time, and to avoid submissions after the deadline, unless you have a valid claim for EC. Problematic filenames You should name the file you submit carefully (see this), and include your student reference number in the filename. Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of feedback. Some other key points to remember: No matter how close to a deadline, work submitted after 4.00pm will be deemed to be late. All late work carries a mark of zero. If you are prevented from submitting work on time due to medical or other extenuating circumstances. Computer-related issues (including dropped internet connections) that prevent submission of coursework cannot be considered as valid extenuating circumstances. Coursework should be submitted electronically via the relevant DLE module site. Submit a single copy on the proper coversheet, and with your student ID number printed clearly on the front page. It’s also helpful to include your student ID number in the header of subsequent pages. Your name should not appear on the coursework itself (we mark work ‘blind’, wherever this is possible, to ensure fairness) Keep an electronic copy of all your coursework until you graduate. "],
["marking-criteria-and-credit-level-descriptors.html", "Marking criteria and ‘credit level descriptors’", " Marking criteria and ‘credit level descriptors’ Credit level descriptors define the level of complexity, relative demand and autonomy expected of a learner on completion of a unit or programme of learning. They provide a description of levels of learning through a hierarchy of knowledge and skills, and the characteristics and context of learning expected. Specific learning outcomes and assessment criteria can be derived from level descriptors. There are 8 ‘levels’ within the scheme used in the UK 9 and masters courses, including the PRM and final year of the MPsych, are at level 7. These are organised under the following headings, and describe things that you (the learner) should demonstrate in your coursework and conduct on the course: Development of Knowledge and Understanding The Learner… Knowledge base …has depth and systematic understanding of knowledge in specialised/applied areas and/across areas and can work with theoretical/research-based knowledge at the forefront of their academic discipline. Ethical issues …has the awareness and ability to manage the implications of ethical dilemmas and work pro-actively with others to formulate solutions. Disciplinary methodologies …has a comprehensive understanding of techniques/methodologies applicable to their own work (theory or research-based). Cognitive and Intellectual Skills The Learner… Analysis …with critical awareness can undertake analysis of complex, incomplete or contradictory areas of knowledge communicating the outcome effectively. Synthesis …with critical awareness, can synthesise information in a manner that may be innovative, utilising knowledge or processes from the forefront of the discipline/practice. Evaluation …has a level of conceptual understanding that will allow her/him critically to evaluate research, advanced scholarship and methodologies and argue alternative approaches. Application …can demonstrate initiative and originality in problem solving. Can act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level, making decisions in complex and unpredictable situations. Key/Transferable Skills The Learner… Group working …can work effectively with a group as leader or member. Can clarify tasks and make appropriate use of the capacities of group members. Is able to negotiate and handle conflict with confidence. Learning resources …is able to use full range of learning resources. Self evaluation …is reflective on own and others’ functioning in order to improve practice. Management of information …can competently undertake research tasks with minimum guidance. Autonomy …is an independent and self critical learner, guiding the learning of others and managing own requirements for continuing professional development. Communications …can engage confidently in academic and professional communication with others, reporting on action clearly, autonomously and competently Problem solving …has independent learning ability required for continuing professional study, making professional use of others where appropriate. Practical Skills The Learner… Application of skills … can operate in complex and unpredictable and/or specialised contexts, and has an overview of the issues governing good practice. Autonomy in skill use …is able to exercise initiative and personal responsibility in professional practice. Technical expertise …has technical expertise, performs smoothly with precision and effectiveness; can adapt skills and design or develop new skills and/or procedures for new situations. Level descriptors, learning outcomes and assessment criteria. There are a range of different types of assignments used on Masters’ modules. For example, your coursework might include: Oral presentations Statistical exercises Essays Grant applications Professional reports Group work Module outlines identify the learning outcomes expected of students and, when setting assessments, staff are encouraged to give clear guidance on what is required. The assessments set will relate to the learning outcomes and enable you to demonstrate the abilities described in the level descriptors. See the SEEC level descriptors document↩ "],
["categorical-and-percentage-grades.html", "Categorical and percentage grades", " Categorical and percentage grades Across the school, all coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging from A+ to F-.

When using only percentage marks, markers are often reluctant to award marks over 90%, for example. Using the full range of the scale helps us identify and reward students achieving at a very high level. "],
["standards-expected.html", "Standards expected", " Standards expected Mapping between level descriptors and grade boundaries can be challenging for students, and so we find that it is useful to provide a general guide as to the standards expected for work at each level of attainment on the MSc and MPsych degrees. Note that although different terminology is used (e.g. Distinction vs. First class award) the boundaries for these award categories overlap across the programmes Distinction (MSc) or First class award (MPsych): &gt;=70%, grades A- to A+ At this level students should submit work which is: Comprehensive and accurate coverage of relevant material. Demonstrates critical evaluation; clarity of argument; integration of material. Insight into theoretical issues and, where appropriate, Originality in exposition and treatment. There should be only very minor omissions, inaccuracies, or defects of presentation. Merit (MSc) or 2:1 (MPsych): 60-69%, grades B- to B+ Students will produce work that is: Accurate, relevant and informed, with good insight Shows only minor omissions and inaccuracies May include less comprehensive theoretical analysis than merits a distinction. Pass (MSc) or 2:2 (MPsych): 50%-59%, grades C- to C+) Coursework will be Generally accurate, relevant and well informed. Reasonably comprehensive Well organised and structured. Have generally clear presentation, with some critical evaluation and understanding shown. However work may also have: Some omissions and errors. Limited understanding or errors in some places. Arguments which are not fully developed, or which fail to address the question. Fail (&lt; 50%, grades D+ and below) Fails to address question or purpose of assessment directly 10 Provides cursory coverage of relevant material. Contains significant inaccuracies. Arguments poorly developed Assertions unsupported by evidence. Poor organisation and style. Marking of presentations Presentations are typically given twice (to separate markers) or recorded for seond marking to take place. This is an example of a presentation marking proforma, which indicates the characteristics markers will be looking for: Referencing guidelines The school requires all coursework to conform to the APA style manual, version 6 11 Writing in APA style is simple but highly valued by many markers. Failure to comply with the rules will cause you to recieve negative feedback and poorer marks. The BPS styleguide is an excellent resource for writing and editing, and uses the APA rules as a basis for it’s recommendations, but adds much more. BPS Style guide (pdf) Unless other instructions are explicitly given by the module leader, you should fully reference each piece of coursework. Do not provide a bibliography in place of a reference list. Do not omit the reference list. However, the reference list does not contribute to the page count for the assessment This is incredibly common in the work of weaker students, and failing to address the question as posed is probably the primary cause of work being awarded a low-pass or fail.↩ see https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/↩ "],
["marking-and-grading.html", "Marking and grading", " Marking and grading All grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second marked, which involves the following steps: Peer moderation The first marker (normally the person who set the work) provides a small sample of coursework to a colleague for independent second marking, normally 6 scripts. The two markers compare the grades they have awarded to this sample and discuss any inconsistencies. Once satisfied that marks are being awarded consistently and at the correct level, the first marker continues to mark coursework from the rest of the cohort in the same fashion. Second marking This applies primarily to project reports. Here the first marker provides feedback for the student, and awards a grade. A second marker also reads the report and awards a second independent mark. Both markers meet to discuss the grade, and where inconsistencies arise these are resolved by discussion, or with reference to the programme leader if no agreement can be found (this is rare). External examiners In addition, all coursework and marking is validated by our external examiner — an independent academic from a different university appointed to uphold standards on our degree programmes. The external examiner will check samples of coursework from across the degree to ensure standards are properly applied, work is marked fairly and that suitable feedback is provided. For this reason, grades awarded during the year are not final and may be subject to amendment by subject examination committees. Queries about grades awarded The grade awarded is holistic in that it reflects the entire assignment. This lots of little details and elements of style and construction within. That means that no particular item, such as an argument or a table, has an overwhelming effect on the mark. Instead it is the overall sum of these elements, plus how the assignment is put together, that determine a grade that best represents the overall quality of the submission. If you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected provided we are made aware of the problem. If you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, or feedback that has been provided, then in the first instance please contact the module leader to discuss it (e.g. during their office hours). It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received, and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the mark immediately. Anonymous marking The University has a clear preference for marking of coursework to be anonymous wherever possible. In brief the policy states: Anonymous assessment should ensure summative assessments are marked as far as possible and where appropriate without the student’s name or identity being made known to the marker or subject assessment panel. Anonymity provides reassurance for students and assessors against the perception of discrimination and bias entering the assessment process, and aims to ensure all students are treated equally. Anonymous assessment should not impede rapid feed forward and feedback to students. The full policy is available here: https://goo.gl/8nZx69 "],
["feedback.html", "Feedback", " Feedback Feedback is information and advice, either to guide your work-in-progress, or help you reflect on work already completed. Feedback is probably the most important thing that your teachers at Plymouth provide; it forms an integral part of the learning process. Your job, if you’re not already an expert, is to learn how to use feedback effectively. Types of feedback In educational jargon, we provide two types of feedback throughout the course: Formative feedback This is to help guide and improve your work in progress. This can come in a wide variety of guides: from peers, informal conversations, in-class-quizz’s, discussions of your work plans, or on feedback on your submitted work, where this can be used to inform future work. Summative feedback This usually comes at the end of a module: for example when you submit coursework and recieve a grade summarising your performance on the module as a whole (i.e. a grade). Formative feedback is by far the most important Students often focus on the grade awarded to their coursework, for obvious reasons. However, this is a mistake because the grade itself: provides no information about why work has been awarded the mark and therefore provides very little information about to guide your future future work Only formative feedback provides oppportunities for action and learning. Types of feedback to expect on the PRM We provide many different ways for students to get feedback on their work, including: Annotations on written work (highlights, stamps, comments) General comments on the front of written work which summarise and contextualise the specific example annotations Generic feedback, provided to the whole cohort, describing things that differentiated strong and weak essays, reports, and exams Verbal feedback in tutorials, tutor meetings, TARA surgeries, and follow-up meetings with module leaders or staff who set assessments Using feedback effectively This section is adapted from Race, 2007, which has many other excellent tips for using feedback effectively. The Working out what written feedback really means! section is particularly enlightening. Take a deep breath. Criticism of our work – even when it is constructive and sensitively written – can elicit strong emotional reactions, and make it harder to learn. It’s perfectly natural to try to protect yourself from the hurt of critical feedback, but the problem then is that this interferes with the flow of critical feedback to you. The more you can gently probe for even more feedback, the more useful the feedback turns out to be. Focus on positives as well as the negatives. Some students skip over praise or other positive comments because they think them less important. But positive comments can help place other suggestions in context, and make them easier to swallow… and you need to keep doing the good things too, so don’t neglect the positives. Ask questions. If you don’t understand something then do talk to your fellow students, compare notes, or email the marker or module leader. Use office hours to discuss feedback (bring a copy of the work and feedback to discuss). See Race, 2007 for other useful suggestions for approaching lecturers. Summarise the feedback in your own words. Make sure all the points make sense to you, and that you can relate them to the work you did. Make a plan. Each time you recieve feedback, make a plan for how you will use this to improve your work next time. Taking the time to think of concrete, actionable steps will make it easier to integrate feedback with your work when you are up against the next deadline. Keep a copy of your feedback (and your summaries and plans). A study journal or ‘blog’ type format can work well. Reflect back over past feedback often and try to spot patterns. When will I get feedback? Marked coursework will be returned via the DLE, within 20 days of submission. If there is a reason for a delay you will be informed; if you notice a delay, please inform the programme lead. "],
["results.html", "Results", " Results When do I get my results? At the end of the academic year, the assessment panel meets to confirm marks for each module. You will then receive a statement of your results in July (which excludes the project). A transcript of your results will then be posted on the DLE. What happens if I fail an assessment? The rules which decide what happens if you fail an assessment are quite complex, but the important facts are: The pass mark for all masters-level programmes is 50% If you don’t submit an assignment you will get a mark of zero If you fail an assessment you may be required to resit some or all of the CW on that module. Marks for repeated coursework are normally capped at 50%^[except where extenuating circumstances apply. If you have questions about assessments and progression on a module please contact the school administrator, Karen Barnet. Please note that all marks awarded are provisional until they have been confirmed by the Award Assessment Board (in June). How many times can I resit an assessment?

["excircs.html", "Extenuating circumstances (EC)", " Extenuating circumstances (EC) The aim of the Extenuating-Circumstances policy is to ensure you are not disadvantaged in your studies by serious, significant circumstances beyond your control. As described in the Plymouth Compass framework (https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/your-university/teaching-and-learning/plymouth-university-compass), we encourage you to become a resilient and thriving individual and a competent and confident professional. This means that, while studying with us, we expect you to be able to deal with the inevitable ups and downs of life, including minor illnesses or personal issues, so that they don’t affect your studies and, in particular, your ability to attend or complete assessments. Sometimes, however, you’ll face a serious situation which has a significant impact on your ability to attend or complete assessments. The University calls such situations ‘extenuating circumstances’ (ECs). This extenuating circumstances policy describes how we can support you by taking such situations into account. The Extenuating-Circumstances policy and guidelines, and an application form, can be found here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/your-studies/essential-information/exams/exam-rules-and-regulations/extenuating-circumstances More detailed information is provided in the policy document here: https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/12/12694/Extenuating_Circumstances_Policy_and_Procedures.pdf Long-term health conditions Long term health conditions can be described as conditions which: are persistent, typically lasting for more than three months and often life-long cannot be resolved in a short time, or which will recur regardless of action, or which need to be managed on a long-term basis are a long-term or permanent illness that often results in some type of disability and which may require you to seek help with various activities can be managed but can ‘flare-up’ Examples of conditions which fall into this category are: Cystic Fibrosis, Costochondritis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME), Psychosis, and Bipolar Disorder. If you have a long-term health condition, you should discuss any support needs with Disability Services (or equivalent in partner institutions) before or soon after commencing your programme of study. It is hoped that the condition can be managed and / or you can be supported sufficiently by Disability Services (or its equivalent in partner institutions). https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/student-life/services/learning-gateway/disability-and-dyslexia However, there may be times when unexpected difficulties or flare-ups arise. On these occasions, you are required to claim extenuating circumstances affecting specific assessments. However, rather than requiring you to provide evidence for your condition with every extenuating circumstance claim, if you have a long-term health condition, you may wish to complete a long-term ill health form, available from the Faculty Office (or equivalent for partner institutions). This form must be accompanied by a statement from your GP, hospital consultant or appropriate specialist responsible for your treatment which provides clear confirmation of the nature, severity, duration and effect of your condition on your studies. You should submit the form to the Faculty Office for consideration. Once a claim is authorised, you will continue to be required to submit an extenuating circumstances claim for any missed assignment submission deadline, test, or examination which is directly attributable to a flare-up of your long-term health condition, but you will not be required to resubmit evidence. As a result of this process, we may need to invoke the Fitness to Study process to consider your case in more detail. You must inform your Faculty or partner institution of any change in your condition, whether improvement or deterioration, in order that the claim can be reassessed. The Faculty or partner institution may require further evidence from time to time. You will be contacted at the start of each academic year to review your case. Fitness to Study The university is committed to an ethos of equality and inclusivity, and aims to facilitate and promote positive health and wellbeing through the recognition and understanding of all relevant health conditions and disabilities. Occasionally a student’s circumstances or health may impact upon their own, or others’ ability to fulfil that potential. Levels of risk will be assessed by the university on a case-by case basis in conjunction with appropriate professionals. The Fitness to Study policy and the accompanying procedures are to be followed by Plymouth University staff where significant concerns have arisen as a result of a student’s extended absence, health condition, wellbeing or other circumstances that lead to an inability to progress in their programme, or that adversely affect others. The key purpose of the policy is to ensure that the best interests of the student are met and to provide appropriate guidance and support.

["academic-dishonesty.html", "Academic dishonesty", " Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, collusion, cheating in exams and fabricating data. These practices and others related to dishonesty probably constitute the dirtiest words in academia, and they are quite properly punished severely where they are detected and proved. It is your job to familiarise yourself with the rules on plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Ignorance of the rules and expectations is not an excuse. University rules on AD The University has very strict regulations about academic dishonesty. You will need to know what counts as academic dishonesty according to the university regulations and make sure you avoid committing any action which could be construed as dishonest. Below is a list of practices which the University has identified as common instances of dishonesty. (these examples are not necessarily exhaustive). Obtaining or attempting to obtain access to an unseen examination or test paper prior to the start of the examination/test. The introduction or use in an examination/test of any books, notes, paper or devices of any kind other than those specifically permitted in the rubric of the paper. Failing to comply with the instructions of an invigilator or examiner, or with the printed instructions for candidates. Removing from an examination or test any script, paper, or other official stationery (whether or not completed) unless specifically authorised by an invigilator or examiner. Being party to any arrangement whereby a person other than the candidate fraudulently represents, or intends to represent, the candidate in an examination or test (personation). Communicating, or attempting to communicate with another student or with any third party other than the invigilator/examiner during an examination or test. Use of crib sheets, revision notes etc at any time during an examination or test. Copying or attempting to copy the work of another student, whether by overlooking his/her work, asking him/her for information, or by any other means. The submission for assessment of material (written, computer-generated, visual or oral) originally produced by another person or persons, without indicating that the material is not original, such that the work could be assumed to be the student’s own. The unauthorised use of the work of another student (whether by taking a hard copy without permission or through access to an electronic copy). The representation of work produced in collaboration with another person or persons as the work of a single candidate. The inclusion in a piece of assessed work (other than an examination or in-class/end-module test) of material which is identical or substantially similar to material which has already been submitted for any other assessment within the University. Making false declarations in an attempt to obtain special examination arrangements or special consideration (e.g. of extenuating circumstances). The presentation of data in laboratory work, projects etc based on work purporting to have been carried out by the student but which has been invented, copied, altered or otherwise falsified. Attempting to persuade another member of the University (student, staff, or invigilator) to participate in any way in actions which would be in breach of this Regulation. Being party to any arrangement which would constitute a breach of this Regulation. Plagiarism Plagiarism is one of the commonest forms of academic dishonesty; it isessentially copying or closely paraphrasing the work of another personwithout clearly indicating what has been copied or the source of thecopying. With the ready availability of the internet and the increasingaccess to on-line resources, it has become ever easier to commitplagiarism. The counter point to this trend is that with moresophisticated computer programmes and internet search engines, it isactually becoming more easy to detect plagiarism. As well as cases where an individual student has intentionally set out to deceive the marker, it is not uncommon for students to commit some form of plagiarism but be unaware that they have committed an offence. In these circumstances, the most common mistakes are for students to: Paraphrase the original source too closely Paraphrase the original source too closely by changing the grammar or individual words of the original only slightly. Even though the student’s work is not a direct quote it is still copying the ideas and expression of those ideas too closely. Solution: make sure you paraphrase key ideas from a source entirely in your own words. Using notes directly Making notes from a source (journal or book) which is a copy the original and then forgetting that your notes are a copy. When you come to write your assessment what you have in your notes sounds good so you use that material in your essay. However what you have put into your essay is a direct quote or a close paraphrase of the original. Even though the student may claim that they did not intend to commit plagiarism, such cases will still be treated as plagiarism and punished accordingly. Solution: When you write notes from another source always make your notes clear about what the source is and what is a quote or close paraphrase. The use of direct quotations The use of direct quotations or lightly paraphrased text without citing the source would be deemed to be an assessment offence. Where work was similarly presented, without quotation marks, but with a clear indication of the source this would be identified as bad practice and marked accordingly. In the latter case, overly-derivative work showing little intellectual input from the student would be likely to be given a low mark, and if extensive the work would be almost certain to fail. Solution: If you must quote a source put the quote in quotation marks and reference it correctly both in the body of the essay and in the full reference list. It is however better to synthesise the ideas and put them into your own words. You will still need to reference the source of the ideas. Preventing academic dishonesty Everyone involved in higher education is responsible for preventing the incidence of academic dishonesty. Prime responsibility rests with students themselves. You can help reduce the incidence of academic dishonesty through following these points of principle: Be organised in your work Students committing academic dishonesty often claim that time pressures and last minute panic led them to cheat. Such panic might be a reason for cheating but it does not excuse it. You can reduce the likelihood of such pressures by being organised, knowing what assessment deadlines you have to meet, and planning your work accordingly. If you are not a good organiser, take advice. Advice is available from your personal tutor, from study skills courses run by the University and from your network of friends and colleagues. Know the rules It is tremendously important to know what counts as academic dishonesty. One problem is of course that there is no hard and fast cut off between honesty and dishonesty; there are gradations between best practice and utterly dishonest practice. It is essential that you get a sense of where the boundary lies on this gradation. In Stage 1, this topic will be discussed as one of the tutorial topics. There are also exercises available on the student portal which aim to help you understand where this boundary lies. Sometimes students plead that ignorance of the rules led them to cheat. Again this ignorance may be a reason for cheating, but it does not excuse it. Don’t ignore dishonest practice There are occasions where you suspect a fellow student of committing academic dishonesty. The most common form of this practice occurs where another student uses or copies your work without your permission. If you suspect that someone is cheating in this way, then you can talk to your personal tutor, the relevant marker, the relevant module leader, the stage tutor or programme co-ordinator all in confidence. If your suspicion is well founded then the member of staff will take steps to detect the cheating without involving you directly. Be aware of detection systems The School of Psychology has systems for checking work submitted for assessments and detecting academic dishonesty. The marker is obviously in a good position to detect cheating such as plagiarism. The School may also ask a randomly selected sample of students to submit electronic copies of their assessment after the deadline has passed. These copies will be subjected to plagiarism detection software which compares the content of essays with that of other student essays and with text on web sites and in journals and books. By being able to match the content of the essay with these different sources, this software now has a very high detection rate for plagiarism. Consequences of academic dishonesty If a marker believes your assessment shows signs of cheating, then the university procedures will be followed. When the student has been informed by the module leader that he or she is suspected of an offence under the university regulations, then they will have an opportunity to discuss this charge with the module leader. The student then has to decide whether to accept the charge or contest it in front of a faculty committee. If a student is found guilty of academic dishonesty then they will be punished, usually as a minimum by having the grade for the work submitted or the module as a whole reduced to zero. Every year, a number of students have their marks reduced and fail the modules concerned. If you have your marks reduced to zero because of academic dishonesty then the impact on your overall mark profile and your eventual degree classification can be high. The information will be kept on your academic file, and may be referred to by your tutor or other member of staff when writing a reference for you after you leave the University. A second offence may lead to removal of the student from their programme of study. "],

Sessions end and key cards must be returned at 12:45 for the morning and 16:45 for the afternoon. You must obtain ethical clearance before booking lab time. Experimental software/hardware The Technical Office can write custom applications and produce special hardware to fill most experimental requirements – contact the technical manager for more information. If requesting the tech office write software for your experiment, we strongly recommend that you: Specify what you want to appear on screen in as much detail as possible, including mockups in power point and with list Specify exactly how you want the data to be recorded, and what variables should be saved Test the software thoroughly before using with participants. This should involve a complete run-through of the experiment followed by an attempt to analyse the resulting data. It is only by attempting to analyse the data saved that many problems can be identified. It can also help to create a paper prototype and test this with other students before sending the spec to the tech office12. Recruiting experimental participants The school runs a participant pool of undergraduates – the Points Pool – who are required to participate in studies as part of their course, and also a panel of paid public participants – the Paid Pool – who provide a wider demographic and are paid £4 for 30 mins if you have the funding. Both pool systems are managed online and can be accessed at: http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/Stage5/. Borrowing Equipment There is a selection of equipment available for loan from the Technical Office, including computers, cassette recorders, stopwatches etc. If you intend to remove the equipment from the campus then a loan form must be signed, as equipment is not insured when off campus. A note on security: All rooms containing equipment must be left locked whenever the room is left unattended even if this is only for a short period. If you are the last person to leave a laboratory it is your responsibility to ensure that it is locked, the technicians in room 109 will always have a key. Particular care should be taken to ensure that the computer labs are not left unlocked when there is nobody using them. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping↩ "],
["conduct-and-contribution-of-the-student.html", "Conduct and contribution of the student", " Conduct and contribution of the student Our aim is that masters projects represent a substantial piece of research, which makes a novel and publishable contribution to the literature. This requirement usually dictates that students will work collaboratively with their supervisor, and both will contribute to the final design and analysis of the study. That is, projects are unlikely to be a truly independent piece of research. As a consequence, we do not customarily make detailed accounting of students’ contribution to projects and try to adjust marks accordingly. The reason is that it is not possible to devise a fair scheme to compensate students for their relative contributions to projects when the different facts of this contribution are not necessarily commensurable. However, we do provide second markers with information about your conduct during the design, running and analysis of the project, and our policy is to use this information where i) the work appears to sit at the threshold between two grade points or ii) to resolve discrepancies between the first and second marker. Thus, a student who submits a manuscript on the borderline between a grade of B+ and A-, but who made a substantial contribution to the design and development of their project, would be awarded the higher of these two grades. To reassure students who are engaging in detailed conversations regarding the design and analysis of their projects: this is both normal an expected. You will not be penalised for this because it is a normal part of science to collaborate with other researchers. Only where such help is deemed excessive, or the student overly-dependent on supervisory assistance would this become an issue, and your supervisor will discuss this with you should this uncommon situation arise.

["publication-of-projects.html", "Publication of Projects", " Publication of Projects Project work should be potentially of publishable standard. Although it is not formally required, we wish strongly to encourage the submission of project work for publication and offer some advice in this section. It will rarely be the case that a project report - however highly marked - will be suitable for submission as a journal article without alteration. Students should therefore consult closely with their supervisor about the amendments needed prior to submission. Since this will occur after the examination process, supervisors will be free to advise in detail and to contribute themselves to the write-up. The authorship of publications arising from projects would normally be joint between the student and supervisor with the student’s name appearing first. This is the default recommended since it is required that the student substantially contribute to design of the project as well as conduct the work, and hence merit first authorship. The level of supervisory input also expected, however, would usually imply justification for the supervisor as second author. Where a project needs considerable rewriting for publication which the student lacks time or skill to complete this, it may be agreed that the supervisor completes the write-up and appears as first author. If a student has not written up their research within two years, then the supervisor may use the research in publications, with themselves as first author and the student as co-author. Any student who succeeds in publishing a project, even if some time after leaving Plymouth, is requested to inform the Psychology modular masters co-ordinator and send a copy of the paper. "],

However, the length of research reports is not a reliable indicator of the effort required to produce it, nor of it’s quality. To communicate your findings, we recommend that you identify a suitable high-impact psychological journal and organise your manuscript according to their authors instructions.

The upper limit for masters dissertations is 10,000 words, excluding tables and references. However we suggest that you aim to keep your report closer to the limits imposed by the major journals, unless there are specific reasons why a longer report is desireable, and you have agreed this with your supervisor. Where a project is overly long, or lacks precision in the writing, then this will be marked down accordingly. To be clear: there is an upper limit of 10,000 words that will only be appropriate in a few cases. Almost all reports will be between 4,500 and 6,500 words, varying with the nature of the project.

Key concepts include: Statistical power Statistical inference and causation Pitfalls of null hypothesis significance testing Handling repeated measures data Missing data Issues in qualitative data analysis Where PRM students propose a project that requires only very simple analysis (e.g. pairwise correlations or simple t-tests) this may be appropriate if the project is methodologically demanding in other areas (e.g. recruitment, complexity of data acquisition), or where this is based on the recommendation of the supervisor.

For all masters courses, the pass mark is 50%. Below are the characteristics of report which markers will use to determine your grade: Introduction The introduction should show: Range, relevance and quality of understanding shown in the student’s reading of literature. Organisation and quality of the prose. You should aim to be concise and precise throughout the report. Clarity of the exposition of the rationale for the study, and the linkage with the literature review. NOTE: Because the project report should be modelled on the form of a journal article, introductions should be focused on specific aims and not contain detailed reviews of literature not directly relevant to the study. Method The methods section should demonstrate Quality of the design and relevance to the objectives of the study. Level of ambition in terms of both the scale of the study and the relative complexity of the methodology employed. This will vary between programmes, and markers will take account of the time available to complete the project: MPsych projects will typically be the simplest, because of time constraints; MSc PRM projects will be the most methodologically ambitious. Competence and thoroughness in the conduct of the study. Presentation of the method section in terms of clarity, organisation, thoroughness and concision.

["academic-references.html", "Academic and character references", " Academic and character references Project supervisors and the PRM programme lead will both, normally, be happy to provide academic and character references for students applying for PhD funding or jobs. Please bear in mind that at busy times of year staff may have quite a few references to write. You can make their job easier, and improve the quality of reference your recieve, by providing: An up to date copy of your CV Details of what the reference is for, and any salient details of the job description or person specficiation you would like your reference to highlight/mention. A quick summary of the highlights of your academic performance (e.g. list modules with best grades, and note what you found interesting about each) The title, grade, and a quick summary of your undergraduate dissertation if you would like this mentioned in the reference (this can be a good idea if it relates to the application in question). Non-academic highlights from your time at Plymouth, which you would like mentioned. Any other outstanding characteristics or activities it would be helpful to note in the reference. By providing these details you make it the whole process much quicker and it is more likely that your positive attributes will be accurately remembered and included in the reference! Supervisors will often provide you a copy of academic references on request, and it can be useful to keep this on file because many employers will accept a generic character reference from-file. "],

This belief is wrong but there is some additional information that you need to know in order to take your interest in teaching further. Some PGCE providers require students to have a degree in a subject related to the national curriculum and you will need to check with individual providers whether they apply this condition. You will also need Maths and English GCSE at grade C or above, and science if you want to teach at Primary level. "]
