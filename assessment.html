<h1>Coursework and Assessment</h1>

<p>Assessment is an important component of the programme, and feedback is vital for
you to progress.</p>
<p>All assessment on the MSc and MPsych is based upon coursework, and we have no formal
examinations. Coursework is tailored to the needs of individual modules. Modules
may have several coursework components which make up the total assessment.</p>
<p><img src="static/scantron.png" /></p>
<p>Assessment is a complex topic, but this section attempts to distill some of the
key information which students need to understand how their work is assessed on
the MSc and MPsych courses at Plymouth, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>‘Level descriptors’: These are broad descriptions of what is expected from
students on each type of course</p></li>
<li><p>Learning outcomes and assessment criteria</p></li>
<li><p>Marking schemes, grade boundaries</p></li>
<li><p>Marking and moderation processes</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="summary" class="section level3">
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>All coursework in the school is marked on a categorical grade system, ranging
from A+ to F-, and all grades awarded to masters coursework are either
peer-moderated or second marked.</p>
<p>Each letter grade category is associated with a particular percentage mark which
is used to calculate the overall degree mark. The pass mark for postgraduate
courses is set at 50%.</p>
<p>Degree classifications are slightly different depending on whether you are and
MSc or MPsych student. See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="mpsych.html#mpsych-classification">MPsych classifications</a></li>
<li><a href="msc.html#msc-classification">MSc classifications</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you ever have a <a href="assessment.html#grade-queries">question about a grade</a> you have been
awarded</em>, in the first instance contact the module leader to discuss it, for
example during their <a href="communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="submitting-coursework" class="section level2">
<h2>Submitting coursework</h2>
<p>All work must be submitted via the DLE. No submissions can be accepted on paper,
or via email, unless this is required to meet specific accessibility
requirements.</p>
<div id="pre-submission-checklist" class="section level3">
<h3>Pre-submission checklist</h3>
<p>Before submitting work, you might like to use the following checklist.</p>
<div class="checklist">
<ul>
<li>☐ Reviewed previous feedback</li>
<li>☐ Spell-checked manuscript</li>
<li>☐ Proofread/grammar-check complete</li>
<li>☐ <a href="assessment.html#cover-sheet">Cover sheet</a> attached</li>
<li>☐ Converted to PDF</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="cover-sheet" class="section level3">
<h3>Coursework cover sheet</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The master’s coursework cover sheet is available here:
<a href="static/templates/Coursework%20Template%20and%20Coversheet%20-%202020-21.docx">masters_coursework_template.docx</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This coversheet includes a section in which you can write your reflections on
your own work. You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a look at the grading criteria described here. Think about your work,
and how it corresponds to those criteria.</li>
<li>Think too about any previous feedback you have had and whether you have
taken heed of it in the writing of the work you are to submit.</li>
<li>Finally, explain to the marker which aspects of your work you particularly
want to get feedback on. Are you worried about your essay structure?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you unsure about how you have set out results? Do you think you’ve strongly
addressed the question? Tell the marker, so that they can address these
questions in their feedback.</p>
</div>
<div id="feedback-to-expect" class="section level3">
<h3>Feedback to expect</h3>
<p>Essays and practical reports include several types of feedback. General comments
on the front of the work are designed to give a brief, and holistic, summary of
the strong and weak points of your work. These general comments reflect the
specific notes and highlights in the text where an example has been highlighted.</p>
<p>Please read the general comments with the specific annotations in mind, and vice
versa, so that you can identify some of the elements that have contributed to
the overall assessment and grade, and use this feedback when reflecting on your
performance on the next piece of work you submit.</p>
</div>
<div id="school-style-guide" class="section level3">
<h3>School style guide</h3>
<p>All coursework should be written using the
<a href="assessment.html#cover-sheet">coursework template provided above</a>.</p>
<p>This document has the correct margins, font, line spacing and so on pre-set.
These requirements are also set out below which you should use unless the module
leader instructs otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Arial 12 point font</li>
<li>Use double line spacing</li>
<li>Use left alignment (not justified text)</li>
<li>The top and bottom margins should be 2.5 cm.</li>
<li><p>The left margin should be 1 cm and the right margin should be 4 cm. The
extra space in the right margin is to allow for written feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>Put your student number on each page (in the Header). Do not put your name
on the pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure the piece of work is
<a href="assessment.html#referencing">referenced according to the APA guidelines</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagrams, figures and tables can be either computer generated or hand drawn
and then scanned. Include diagrams and figures within the body of the
assessment rather than on separate pages as appendices. Label each diagram,
figure or table with a number and a clear and brief title.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="page-or-word-limits" class="section level3">
<h3>Page or word limits</h3>
<p>For some coursework, the module leader will specify a word limit. Where a page
or word limit is specified, you must adhere to it and use
<a href="#coversheet">the school specified format</a>. Failure to do so may incur a mark
penalty.</p>
<p>For other coursework a module leader may instead stipulate a maximum number of
pages using the <a href="#coversheet">School’s style guidelines</a>. You must follow the
presentation guidelines above in order to conform to the stipulated number of
pages for the assessment. If you exceed this page length or you do not follow
the style guidelines then your work will be penalised by the deduction of
grades.</p>
<p>The specified page limit excludes the reference list and the page reflecting on
past feedback (see above).</p>
<p>The deductions for exceeding the page limit will be applied as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to 1 page over the stipulated length: 1 grade reduction</li>
<li>Up to 2 pages over the stipulated length: 2 grade reduction</li>
<li>Up to 3 pages over the stipulated length: 3 grade reduction</li>
<li>Up to 4 or more pages over the stipulated length: 4 grade reduction</li>
</ul>
<p>A one-grade reduction means, for example, that would receive a B- instead of a
B. A four-grade reduction would mean that you receive a C- instead of a B.</p>
<p>There will also be grade deductions if you submit work which does not conform to
the style guidelines. Deductions will be made according to the extent of
deviation from the style guidelines and the overall length of the submitted
assessment.</p>

<div id="filenames" class="section level3">
<h3>Naming files to submit</h3>
<p>You should name your file according to the following scheme:</p>
<p><code>&lt;ModuleCode&gt;_&lt;SRN&gt;_&lt;AssignmentName&gt;.pdf</code></p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<p><code>PSY555_12345678_Portfolio.pdf</code></p>
<p>would be student 12345678’s portfolio for PSY555.</p>
<p>Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word
to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of
feedback.</p>
</div>
<div id="submitting-coursework" class="section level3">
<h3>Coursework submission on the DLE</h3>
<p>Please note the following important points about submitting work on the DLE.</p>
<p>When you submit work on the DLE, you may notice that you can submit multiple
times. Some students find this helpful. It also allows students who are in the
process of claiming <a href="when-things-go-wrong.html#excircs">extenuating circumstances</a> (EC) to submit a draft
of their work, to guard against the possibility their claim for EC is not
granted. HOWEVER, this means that it is possible for you to submit work after
the deadline, and you should know that if you do this without valid EC your mark
will be capped at 50%.</p>
<p>This capping occurs even if you have previously submitted a draft before the
deadline, because the DLE does not record the content of this submission, and we
can mark only the latest one added.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consequently, it’s extremely important for you to submit on time, and to
avoid submissions after the deadline, unless you have a valid claim for
<a href="when-things-go-wrong.html#excircs">EC</a>.</em></strong></p>
<div id="problematic-filenames" class="section level4">
<h4>Problematic filenames</h4>
<p>You should name the file you submit carefully (<a href="assessment.html#filenames">see this</a>), and
include your student reference number in the filename.</p>
<p>Please DON’T use any ‘special’ characters in filenames (e.g. %?/!) or allow Word
to name your file for you. This can lead to delays in marking and return of
feedback.</p>
</div>
<div id="points-to-remember" class="section level4">
<h4>Points to remember:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>No matter how close to a deadline, work submitted after 4.00pm will be
deemed to be late. <strong><em>All late work carries a mark of zero.</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>If you are prevented from submitting work on time due to medical or other
<a href="when-things-go-wrong.html#excircs">extenuating circumstances</a>. Computer-related issues (including
dropped internet connections) that prevent submission of coursework cannot
be considered as valid extenuating circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Coursework should be submitted electronically via the relevant DLE module
site.</p></li>
<li><p>Submit a single copy on the proper coversheet, and with your student ID
number printed clearly on the front page. It’s also helpful to include your
student ID number in the header of subsequent pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Your name should not appear on the coursework itself (we mark work ‘blind’,
wherever this is possible, to ensure fairness)</p></li>
<li><p>Keep an electronic copy of all your coursework until you graduate (or later,
to show potential employers etc).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="marking-criteria-and-credit-level-descriptors" class="section level2">
<h2>Marking criteria and ‘credit level descriptors’</h2>
<p>Credit level descriptors define the level of complexity, relative demand and
autonomy expected of a learner on completion of a unit or programme of learning.
They provide a description of levels of learning through a hierarchy of
knowledge and skills, and the characteristics and context of learning expected.
Specific learning outcomes and assessment criteria can be derived from level
descriptors.</p>
<p>There are 8 ‘levels’ within the scheme used in the UK <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>
and masters courses, including the MSc and final year of the MPsych, are at
level 7. These are organised under the following headings, and describe things
that you (the learner) should demonstrate in your coursework and conduct on the
course:</p>

<p>Our experience is that using categorical grades helps markers to remember to use
the full range of the marking scale. When using only percentage marks, markers
are often reluctant to award marks over 90%, for example. Using the full range
of the scale helps us identify and reward students achieving at a very high
level.</p>

<h2>Standards expected</h2>
<p>Mapping between level descriptors and grade boundaries can be challenging for
students, and so we find that it is useful to provide a general guide as to the
standards expected for work at each level of attainment on the MSc and MPsych
degrees.</p>
<p>Note that although different terminology is used (e.g. Distinction vs. First
class award) the boundaries for these award categories overlap across the
programmes</p>

<li>Demonstrates critical evaluation; clarity of argument; integration of

<h3>Referencing guidelines</h3>
<p>The school requires all coursework to conform to the APA style manual, version 6.
<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>The library has prepared a useful guide for citing and referencing in APA style:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://plymouth.libguides.com/APA">Library APA referencing guide</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Writing in APA style is simple but highly valued by many markers. Failure to
comply with the rules will cause you to recieve negative feedback and poorer
marks.</strong></p>
<p>The BPS styleguide is an excellent resource for writing and editing, and uses
the APA rules as a basis for it’s recommendations, but adds much more.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/Policy%20-%20Files/BPS%20Style%20Guide.pdf">BPS Style guide (pdf)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Unless other instructions are explicitly given by the module leader, you should
fully reference each piece of coursework. Do not provide a bibliography in place
of a reference list. Do not omit the reference list. However, the reference list
does not contribute to the page count for the assessment</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="marking-and-grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Marking and grading</h2>
<p>All grades awarded to masters coursework are either peer-moderated or second
marked, which involves the following steps:</p>
<p>Peer moderation : The first marker (normally the person who set the work)
provides a small sample of coursework to a colleague for independent second
marking, normally 6 scripts. The two markers compare the grades they have
awarded to this sample and discuss any inconsistencies. Once satisfied that
marks are being awarded consistently and at the correct level, the first marker
continues to mark coursework from the rest of the cohort in the same fashion.</p>
<p>Second marking : This applies primarily to project reports. Here the first
marker provides feedback for the student, and awards a grade. A second marker
also reads the report and awards a second independent mark. Both markers meet to
discuss the grade, and where inconsistencies arise these are resolved by
discussion, or with reference to the programme leader if no agreement can be
found (this is rare).</p>
<p>External examiners : In addition, all coursework and marking is validated by our
external examiner — an independent academic from a different university
appointed to uphold standards on our degree programmes. The external examiner
will check samples of coursework from across the degree to ensure standards are
properly applied, work is marked fairly and that suitable feedback is provided.
For this reason, grades awarded during the year are not final and may be subject
to amendment by subject examination committees.</p>
<div id="grade-queries" class="section level3">
<h3>Queries about grades awarded</h3>
<p>The grade awarded is holistic in that it reflects the entire assignment. This
lots of little details and elements of style and construction within. That means
that no particular item, such as an argument or a table, has an overwhelming
effect on the mark. Instead it is the overall sum of these elements, plus how
the assignment is put together, that determine a grade that best represents the
overall quality of the submission.</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with your mark, you cannot ask for it to be re-marked simply
because you question the marker’s academic judgement. If a clerical error (such
as entering an incorrect grade) has been made then the mark can be corrected
provided we are made aware of the problem.</p>
<p>If you have a question about a grade you have been awarded, or feedback that has
been provided, then in the first instance please contact the module leader to
discuss it (e.g. during their <a href="communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a>).</p>
<p>It would be helpful to bring a copy of the work and feedback you have received,
and to highlight any areas of concern. In most cases the module leader will be
able to explain the mark awarded or, where an error has occurred, correct the
mark immediately.</p>
</div>
<div id="anonymous-marking" class="section level3">
<h3>Anonymous marking</h3>
<p>The University has a clear preference for marking of coursework to be anonymous
wherever possible. In brief the policy states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anonymous assessment should ensure summative assessments are marked as far
as possible and where appropriate without the student’s name or identity
being made known to the marker or subject assessment panel.</li>
<li>Anonymity provides reassurance for students and assessors against the
perception of discrimination and bias entering the assessment process, and
aims to ensure all students are treated equally.</li>
<li>Anonymous assessment should not impede rapid feed forward and feedback to
students.</li>

<div id="feedback" class="section level2">
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>Feedback is information and advice, either to guide your work-in-progress, or
help you reflect on work already completed.</p>
<p>Feedback is probably <em>the</em> most important thing that your teachers at Plymouth
provide; it forms an integral part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Your job, if you’re not already an expert, is to learn how to use feedback
effectively.</p>
<div id="types-of-feedback" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of feedback</h3>
<p>In educational jargon, we provide two types of feedback throughout the course:</p>
<p>Formative feedback : This is to help guide and improve your work in progress.
This can come in a wide variety of guides: from peers, informal conversations,
in-class-quizz’s, discussions of your work plans, or on feedback on your
submitted work, where this can be used to inform future work.</p>
<p>Summative feedback : This usually comes at the end of a module: for example when
you submit coursework and recieve a grade summarising your performance on the
module as a whole (i.e. a grade).</p>
</div>
<div id="formative-feedback-is-by-far-the-most-important" class="section level3">
<h3>Formative feedback is by far the most important</h3>
<p>Students often focus on the grade awarded to their coursework, for obvious
reasons. However, this is a mistake because the grade itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides no <em>information</em> about <em>why</em> work has been awarded the mark and
therefore</li>
<li>provides very little information about to guide your future future work</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Only formative feedback provides oppportunities for action and learning.</em></p>
</div>
<div id="types-of-feedback-to-expect" class="section level3">
<h3>Types of feedback to expect</h3>
<p>We provide many different ways for students to get feedback on their work,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Annotations on written work (highlights, stamps, comments)</li>
<li>General comments on the front of written work which summarise and
contextualise the specific example annotations</li>
<li>Generic feedback, provided to the whole cohort, describing things that
differentiated strong and weak essays, reports, and exams</li>
<li>Verbal feedback in tutorials, tutor meetings, TARA surgeries, and follow-up
meetings with module leaders or staff who set assessments</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="using-feedback-effectively" class="section level3">
<h3>Using feedback effectively</h3>
<p>This section is adapted from
<a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/2/2532/Building_on_feedback_Phil_Race.doc">Race, 2007</a>,
which has many other excellent tips for using feedback effectively. The <em>Working
out what written feedback really means!</em> section is particularly enlightening.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Take a deep breath. Criticism of our work – even when it is constructive
and sensitively written – can elicit strong emotional reactions, and make
it harder to learn. It’s perfectly natural to try to protect yourself from
the hurt of critical feedback, but the problem then is that this interferes
with the flow of critical feedback to you. The more you can gently probe for
even more feedback, the more useful the feedback turns out to be.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on positives as well as the negatives. Some students skip over praise
or other positive comments because they think them less important. But
positive comments can help place other suggestions in context, and make them
easier to swallow… and you need to keep doing the good things too, so
don’t neglect the positives.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask questions. If you don’t understand something then do talk to your fellow
students, compare notes, or email the marker or module leader. Use
<a href="communication.html#office-hours">office hours</a> to discuss feedback (bring a copy of the work
and feedback to discuss). See
<a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/uploads/production/document/path/2/2532/Building_on_feedback_Phil_Race.doc">Race, 2007</a>
for other useful suggestions for approaching lecturers.</p></li>
<li><p>Summarise the feedback in your own words. Make sure all the points make
sense to you, and that you can relate them to the work you did.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a plan. Each time you recieve feedback, make a plan for how you will
use this to improve your work next time. Taking the time to think of
concrete, actionable steps will make it easier to integrate feedback with
your work when you are up against the next deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a copy of your feedback (and your summaries and plans). A study journal
or ‘blog’ type format can work well. Reflect back over past feedback often
and try to spot patterns.</p></li>

<h3>The Plymouth Award</h3>
<p>The ‘Plymouth Award’ is a University-wide scheme designed to recognise the
extra-curricular achievements of our students, pulling an individual’s life-wide
experiences together into a portfolio of experience, reflections and learning
outcomes. We know that our students are involved in a wide range of activities
and we want to enhance and celebrate these achievements. Participants are
required to carry out a minimum number of hours of activity from no less than
three out of five key strands, and to complete this over the duration of their
studies. A final award will be made to the student at the time of graduating.</p>
<p>The strands of activity include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal health and well being</li>
<li>Working life</li>
<li>Volunteering</li>
<li>Cultural and social awareness</li>
<li>Supporting the University community</li>

<h2>Academic dishonesty</h2>


<p>Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, collusion, cheating in exams and fabricating data. These practices and others related to dishonesty probably constitute the dirtiest words in academia, and they are quite properly punished severely where they are detected and proved.</p>
<p>It is your job to familiarise yourself with the rules on plagiarism and academic dishonesty. Ignorance of the rules and expectations is not an excuse.</p>
<div id="university-rules-on-ad" class="section level3">
<h3>University rules on AD</h3>
<p>The University has very strict regulations about academic dishonesty. You will need to know what counts as academic dishonesty according to the university regulations and make sure you avoid committing any action which could be construed as dishonest.</p>
<p>Below is a list of practices which the University has identified as common instances of dishonesty.
(these examples are not necessarily exhaustive).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obtaining or attempting to obtain access to an unseen examination or test paper prior to the start
of the examination/test.</p></li>
<li><p>The introduction or use in an examination/test of any books, notes, paper or devices of any kind other
than those specifically permitted in the rubric of the paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Failing to comply with the instructions of an invigilator or examiner, or with the printed
instructions for candidates.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing from an examination or test any script, paper, or other official stationery (whether or not
completed) unless specifically authorised by an invigilator or
examiner.</p></li>
<li><p>Being party to any arrangement whereby a person other than the candidate fraudulently
represents, or intends to represent, the candidate in an examination or
test (personation).</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating, or attempting to communicate with another student or with any third party other than
the invigilator/examiner during an examination or test.</p></li>
<li><p>Use of crib sheets, revision notes etc at any time during an examination or test.</p></li>
<li><p>Copying or attempting to copy the work of another student, whether by overlooking his/her work, asking
him/her for information, or by any other means.</p></li>
<li><p>The submission for assessment of material (written, computer-generated, visual or oral) originally
produced by another person or persons, without indicating that the
material is not original, such that the work could be assumed to be the
student’s own.</p></li>
<li><p>The unauthorised use of the work of another student (whether by taking a hard copy without
permission or through access to an electronic copy).</p></li>
<li><p>The representation of work produced in collaboration with another person or persons as the work of
a single candidate.</p></li>
<li><p>The inclusion in a piece of assessed work (other than an examination or in-class/end-module test) of
material which is identical or substantially similar to material which
has already been submitted for any other assessment within the
University.</p></li>
<li><p>Making false declarations in an attempt to obtain special examination arrangements or special
consideration (e.g. of extenuating circumstances).</p></li>
<li><p>The presentation of data in laboratory work, projects etc based on work purporting to have been
carried out by the student but which has been invented, copied, altered
or otherwise falsified.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempting to persuade another member of the University (student, staff, or invigilator) to participate in any way in actions which would be in breach of this Regulation.</p></li>
<li><p>Being party to any arrangement which would constitute a breach of this Regulation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="plagiarism" class="section level3">
<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is one of the commonest forms of academic dishonesty; it isessentially copying or closely paraphrasing the work of another personwithout clearly indicating what has been copied or the source of thecopying. With the ready availability of the internet and the increasingaccess to on-line resources, it has become ever easier to commitplagiarism. The counter point to this trend is that with moresophisticated computer programmes and internet search engines, it isactually becoming more easy to detect plagiarism.</p>
<p>As well as cases where an individual student has intentionally set out to deceive the marker, it is not uncommon for students to commit some form of plagiarism but be unaware that they have committed an offence. In these circumstances, the most common mistakes are for students to:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Paraphrase the original source too closely</dt>
<dd><p>Paraphrase the original source too closely by changing the grammar or individual words of the original only slightly. Even though the student’s work is not a direct
quote it is still copying the ideas and expression of those ideas too closely.</p>
<p>Solution: make sure you paraphrase key ideas from a source entirely in your own words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Using notes directly</dt>
<dd><p>Making notes from a source (journal or book) which is a copy the original and then forgetting that your notes are a copy. When you come to write your assessment what you have in your notes sounds good so you use that material in your essay. However what you have put into your essay is a direct quote or a close paraphrase of the original. Even though the student may claim that they did not intend to commit plagiarism, such cases will still be treated as plagiarism and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>Solution: When you write notes from another source always make your notes clear about what the source is and what is a quote or close paraphrase.</p>
</dd>
<dt>The use of direct quotations</dt>
<dd><p>The use of direct quotations or lightly paraphrased text without citing the source would be deemed to be an assessment offence. Where work was similarly presented, without quotation marks, but with a clear indication of the source this would be identified as bad practice and marked accordingly. In the latter case,
overly-derivative work showing little intellectual input from the student would be likely to be given a low mark, and if extensive the work would be almost certain to fail.</p>
<p>Solution: If you must quote a source put the quote in quotation marks and reference it correctly both in the body of the essay and in the full reference list. It is however better to synthesise the ideas and put them into your own words. You will still need to reference the source of the ideas.</p>

</div>
<div id="preventing-academic-dishonesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Preventing academic dishonesty</h3>
<p>Everyone involved in higher education is responsible for preventing the incidence of academic dishonesty. Prime responsibility rests with students themselves. You can help reduce the incidence of academic dishonesty through following these points of principle:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Be organised in your work</dt>
<dd>Students committing academic dishonesty often claim that time pressures and last minute panic led them to cheat. Such panic might be a reason for cheating but it does not excuse it. You can reduce the likelihood of such pressures by being organised, knowing what assessment deadlines you have to meet, and planning your work accordingly. If you are not a good organiser, take advice. Advice is available from your personal tutor, from study skills courses run by the University and from your network of friends and colleagues.
</dd>
<dt>Know the rules</dt>
<dd>It is tremendously important to know what counts as
academic dishonesty. One problem is of course that there is no hard and fast cut off between honesty and dishonesty; there are gradations between best practice and utterly dishonest practice. It is essential that you get a sense of where the boundary lies on this gradation. In Stage 1, this topic will be discussed as one of the tutorial topics. There are also exercises available on the student portal which aim to help you understand where this boundary lies. Sometimes students plead that ignorance of the rules led them to cheat. Again this ignorance may be a reason for cheating, but it does not excuse it.
</dd>
<dt>Don’t ignore dishonest practice</dt>
<dd>There are occasions where you suspect a fellow student of committing academic dishonesty. The most common form of this practice occurs where another student uses or copies your work without your permission. If you suspect that someone is cheating in this way, then you can talk to your personal tutor, the relevant marker, the relevant module leader, the stage tutor or programme co-ordinator all in confidence. If your suspicion is well founded then the member of staff will take steps to detect the cheating without involving you directly.
</dd>
<dt>Be aware of detection systems</dt>
<dd>The School of Psychology has systems for checking work submitted for assessments and detecting academic dishonesty. The marker is obviously in a good position to detect cheating such as plagiarism. The School may also ask a randomly selected sample of students to submit electronic copies of their assessment after the deadline has passed. These copies will be subjected to plagiarism detection software which compares the content of essays with that of other student essays and with text on web sites and in journals and books. By being able to match the content of the essay with these different sources, this software now has a very high detection rate for plagiarism.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="consequences-of-academic-dishonesty" class="section level3">
<h3>Consequences of academic dishonesty</h3>
<p>If a marker believes your assessment shows signs of cheating, then the university procedures will be followed.</p>
<p>When the student has been informed by the module
leader that he or she is suspected of an offence under the university regulations, then they will have an opportunity to discuss this charge with the module leader. The student then has to decide whether to accept the charge or contest it in front of a faculty committee.</p>
<p>If a student is found guilty of academic dishonesty then they will be punished, usually as a minimum by having the grade for the work submitted or the module as a whole reduced to zero.</p>
<p>Every year, a number of students have their marks reduced
and fail the modules concerned. If you have your marks reduced to zero because of academic dishonesty then the impact on your overall mark profile and your eventual degree classification can be high. The information will be kept on your academic file, and may be referred to by your tutor or other member of staff when writing a reference for you after you leave the University. A second offence may lead to removal of the student from their programme of study.</p>
